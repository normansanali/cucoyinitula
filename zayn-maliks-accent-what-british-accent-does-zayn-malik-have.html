This means that you get some people who sound like they’ve just stepped out of a hagiographical period piece about royalty, while another person born just down the road might be giving more Peaky Blinders than The Crown. And, much to the apparent dismay of many global fans of One Direction, this shockingly diverse landscape of accents also includes pop stars from the British Isles.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=714 data-current-count=714 data-injectable=true><strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Zayn Malik</a></strong>, former member of the boy band that brought us Harry Styles, the singer (yay!) — and Harry Styles, the actor (dear lord, no) — has recently reappeared in the public eye after a few years out from under the spotlight. And, given the weird, classically ignorant response of the internet to his return — an interview with the podcast Call Her Daddy, in which he discusses his new music and his relationships with the women in his life — he might have been right to stay away. But press is necessary, so the boy from Bradford is out there trying to make it work, even if <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">many of his fans are struggling</a> to square the notion of Britishness with someone who actually speaks like a normal Brit.</p><p data-characters=215 data-current-count=215 data-injectable=false>If you’re one of the many people who’ve been bamboozled by the former boy band member’s (mild, in the grand scheme of things) accent, then read ahead to find out what British accent Zayn Malik has.</p><h2 id=h-what-british-accent-does-zayn-malik-have data-injectable=false>What British accent does Zayn Malik have?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Zayn-Malik-4.jpg><p data-characters=381 data-current-count=381 data-injectable=false>Zayn Malik is from a town called Bradford, which is in East Yorkshire, and has what most of his fellow countryfolk would describe as a <strong>broad Yorkshire accent</strong>. Bradford is one of the most diverse cities in the U.K., though, so not everybody who lives there would speak like him. However, it would definitely be the predominant accent a visitor wandering around the town would hear.</p><p data-characters=480 data-current-count=861 data-injectable=true>The Yorkshire accent is pretty recognizable to anybody who’s spent an extended period of time in the U.K., and although it varies across the large region, it’s easy to distinguish from a more southern accent, or those that are a little more hyper-regional like Scouse and Geordie accents. With that said, those in North Yorkshire tend to sound a little more like their northern counterparts in Newcastle and Sunderland, although elements of Zayn’s accent remain.</p><p data-characters=599 data-current-count=599 data-injectable=true>There are a lot of characteristics that make the accent so unique. The letter “h” is often dropped, and in words like “bath” and “dance,” the “a” is shortened. The “er” sound you’d get in a word like “thirst” is changed so it’s more like “thust,” and there are a lot of extended vowel sounds (“name” is pronounced a little more like “nay-em,” and most words with a double-o sound are said more like “oo-er” (so “floor” would become “floo-er”).</p><p data-characters=479 data-current-count=479 data-injectable=true>Linguistically speaking, it’s a really interesting place to study, but we’re going to assume most people reading this don’t know their diphthongs from their schwas, so we’ll leave the technicalities behind. If you want to practice your Yorkshire accent, then we suggest catching an episode of the long-running British soap opera Emmerdale, or listening to Malik’s former bandmate Louis Tomlinson speak, as he has a milder version of the same accent.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Where is Yorkshire?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Yorkshire-Old-Map.jpg><p data-characters=525 data-current-count=825 data-injectable=true>Yorkshire is in the north of England and is one of the largest regions in the entire country. It’s one of the most historic counties in the country thanks to its plethora of ancient monuments, as well as its association with the House of York, one of the sides in the famous War of the Roses back in the 15th century. The people of the county are notoriously proud, and a common joke about them is “How do you tell if someone is from Yorkshire? They’ll mention it within five minutes of meeting you.”</p><p data-characters=467 data-current-count=467 data-injectable=true>After all, this is a place that nicknamed itself “God’s Own Country,” so humility isn’t its biggest export. With that said, it is home to some stunning natural beauty, as well as the historic towns that make it so intriguing. Additionally, in the London 2012 Olympics, if Yorkshire had been its own country, it would have finished 12th, and they’re also the home of the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Arctic Monkeys</a>, so maybe there is something to all that confidence.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Why was Zayn Malik out of the public eye for so long?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Zayn-Malik-2.jpg><p data-characters=479 data-current-count=779 data-injectable=true>Malik is definitely one of the more reclusive former One Direction members, and part of this is because of mental health issues. He has been very open about his grapples with anxiety, having canceled numerous gigs because of his struggles with the affliction. In 2021, he was also sentenced by a Pennsylvania court to probation for just under a year, and completion of anger management and domestic violence education programs after he had an altercation with his <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">former partner</a>.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>When is Zayn Malik’s new album out?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Zayn-Malik-3.jpg><p data-characters=422 data-current-count=722 data-injectable=true>In late 2022, Malik confirmed he was making a new album by updating his <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Spotify</a> bio with the line: “Zayn is currently working on his highly anticipated fourth studio album.” It was later revealed that he had signed to Mercury Records. The album is set to be released this summer, although no official date has been announced. However, we have to assume it’s close, given he’s now out and about doing press.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Will One Direction make a comeback?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/One-Direction.jpg><p data-characters=478 data-current-count=778 data-injectable=false>With several members of One Direction either releasing new solo music or on worldwide tours, it doesn’t appear that the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">X-Factor</a>-formed boy band is likely to be mounting a comeback any time soon. So, sadly fans of the “What Makes You Beautiful” singers will have to make do with the upcoming albums from Zayn and Niall, or somehow manage to snag themselves a Harry Styles ticket. On the bright side, they should now know what to expect when Zayn stops singing.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2THosXNZqSapJmgwG6twpycp6xdrLWiwIybqaKsmai1bq3CnJynrF2ZvKa%2FjLOYsqZdoq6ttcpmn5qulWQ%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./claire-danes.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Claire Danes - Career, Bio, Married, Age, Net Worth, Height, Facts">&larr;
