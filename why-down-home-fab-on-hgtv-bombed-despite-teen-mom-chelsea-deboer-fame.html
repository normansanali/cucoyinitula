After years of starring on MTV's Teen Mom 2, <a href=#>Chelsea renovated a farmhouse</a> and realized how much she loved the process. Her 6.7 million Instagram followers know that she lives in a peaceful home with husband Cole DeBoer and their three kids named Layne, Walker, and Watson, along with Chelsea's daughter Aubree whom she shares with her ex Adam Lind. Now that Chelsea and Cole have an HGTV show called Down Home Fab, it's hard to believe that <a href=#>Chelsea would ever go back to Teen Mom 2</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Chelsea DeBoer is a huge reality star and fans have been following her since she starred on 16 And Pregnant. But even though she is super popular, not all of her fans are enjoying her new show. What have Chelsea DeBoer's fans said about her HGTV series Down Home Fab?</p><h2 id=how-do-fans-feel-about-chelsea-deboer-39-s-hgtv-show-down-home-fab>How Do Fans Feel About Chelsea DeBoer's HGTV Show Down Home Fab?</h2><p><a href=#>Chelsea DeBoer wanted to leave Teen Mom 2</a> and it seems that she is happier now. She seems to love transforming homes and figuring out the best color scheme and decor to bring her vision to life. Down Home Fab premiered on January 16th, 2023, and in each episode, Chelsea and Cole work with a couple to create an awesome home.</p><p>Of course, at this point, these types of shows are a dime a dozen on HGTV. But there is still a huge audience for them since watching people renovate and decorate houses can be fun and voyeuristic. But do fans feel that Down Home Fab is the right show for Chelsea, and do they like her design ideas?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It turns out that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">fans aren't loving Down Home Fab</a> and have discussed the episodes on Reddit. Redditor @AMH624 started a thread called "Down Home Fab-Yikes!" The fan wrote that they didn't like Chelsea's design choices including the decision to include a "Pink fireplace w/Disco balls" in the decor.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/cole-and-chelsea-deboer-down-home-fab.jpg><p>Fans are also confused because when a client will tell Chelsea what their preferred design style is, she does the opposite. Redditor @oddsmaker90 wrote of one episode, "The couple wanted farmhouse and she gave them mid century. It’s very obvious how unseasoned she is."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>There's One Thing Fans Say Doesn't Add Up About Chelsea Houska's Time On MTV's Teen Mom</a></span></p><p>In another Reddit thread, viewers questioned why Chelsea uses so much black in the homes she is working on. Redditor @jgray68 wrote, "Watched two episodes and had enough. Too much black and trying too hard to come up with what she thinks is a 'style' (like Ranch glam). She ruined that fireplace with the whitewash and the room was too dark with all that dark green."</p><p>Redditor @oddsmaker90 doesn't think the houses look good after Chelsea has done her work: "The designs look so cheap for how big the budgets are! I felt like the houses looked better before her designs."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/chelsea-cole-deboer.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>What many fans seem to agree on is that Chelsea doesn't have a design background. Some prefer tuning into HGTV series with experts who have been working with clients for a long time. Redditor @DucatiSteve1299 wrote, "With this show; Down Home Fab, HGTV is jumping the shark. They used to have some really talented designers here."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Viewers Say 'Teen Mom' Cheyenne Had This In Common With Chelsea Houska</a></span></p><p>Fans who follow Chelsea DeBoer on Instagram are familiar with her design aesthetic. She favors a lot of black and her style could be described as farmhouse shabby chic.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/chelsea-deboer-1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While Chelsea seems to enjoy this type of home decor, not everyone agrees that this is the way to go. Many of her fans seem to wish that she would focus on other design styles when working on Down Home Fab. On the one hand, it makes sense that Chelsea would follow her heart when it comes to what she wants the houses to look like. This is her show, after all.</p><p>But on the other hand, fans think that Chelsea should listen to clients instead of making all the houses look similar. And that's a fair point. There's often tension between the vision that a designer has and what the client is looking for.</p><h2 id=what-did-chelsea-deboer-say-about-fan-response-to-down-home-fab>What Did Chelsea DeBoer Say About Fan Response To Down Home Fab?</h2><p>Chelsea DeBoer is definitely used to people talking about her after years of starring on Teen Mom 2. And she must have anticipated the fact that her fanbase has many opinions about Down Home Fab.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Chelsea spoke about Down Home Fab</a> in a January 2023 interview with The Ashley's Reality Roundup and shared what she thinks about people who have had negative things to say about her new show.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/cole-and-chelsea-deboer-down-home-fab-1.jpg><p>Chelsea said that she knows that she and her husband Cole haven't starred on a home renovation and home decor show before. And that's just fine with her.</p><p>Chelsea explained to The Ashley's Reality Roundup, "This is something we take very seriously. This business is new to us, and you can follow along and watch us get our feet wet."</p><p>Chelsea also said that she and Cole have a passion for home renovation and they have done their best to educate themselves on what they can. She said, “We are just going into this. This is a new thing for us. We’re learning as we go, and also that’s part of the story. We’re learning how to do this and juggle everything in our lives. When we started building our house, it became our life. We were researching absolutely everything we could research and reading every book we could find."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Here’s What Chelsea Houska Has Done Since Leaving ‘Teen Mom 2’</a></span></p><p>While people might not love Chelsea's design work on Down Home Fab, she seems to love making the series. She told Heavy.com that it is "natural" and "rewarding" to film Down Home Fab. And she said she is "proud."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/chelsea-deboer.jpg><p>Even though many people don't love Down Home Fab, the show did well enough to get a season 2. According to Pop Culture, HGTV renewed it in February 2023. At that point, it had over 6 million "total viewers. The HGTV Head of Content, Loren Ruch, praised the couple's "undeniable on-screen chemistry and enthusiasm for renovation."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Perhaps when season 2 of Down Home Fab premieres, fans will like Chelsea's work more, and they will give it better reviews.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdmby4uoyhpqadXZuuo3nOp2Shn6SreqO7zJucnWWUmsCxtdOeZK2dlaN6rrvMZpqhnZyosqJ5w56ZqJ2iYrOiucRo</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./1415864-wwe-nxt-halloween-havoc-week-one-results-10-24-23.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="WWE NXT Halloween Havoc Week One Results (10/24/23)">&larr;
