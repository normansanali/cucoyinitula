Now that the idea of quiet confidence, an air of mystery, and bravado-free magnetism is common parlance, we’d like to introduce you to a similar sort of “energy.” But this one comes steeped in bravado — it's big Aries energy.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">BAE, as we’ll refer to it, is a complex combination of conviction, unstoppable motivation, and almost blind confidence that most Aries people exude. Where BDE was winking and subtle, BAE hits you like a wave of heat from a bonfire. It’s Mariah Carey <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>saying “I don’t know her”</a> when asked about fellow extremely famous person Jennifer Lopez. It’s Reese Witherspoon running a lifestyle brand, while starring in and producing spring’s most anticipated TV drama. It’s Celine Dion doing...everything that Celine Dion does.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If you’re an Aries, you might be a little more competitive, hot-headed, and, to put it gently, focused on yourself than most. Don’t get us wrong — Aries people also tend to be fiercely loyal and protective friends, but, as the first sign on the Wheel of Zodiac, it’s only natural that you have a bit of a me-first attitude. Of course, if you’re a celebrity and have grown accustomed to others putting you first, those tendencies can get turned up to 11. And thus, BAE is born.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Once you start to look for BAE in Aries celebs and those you know IRL, you won’t be able to ignore it — kind of like when you realized that Pete Davidson really does have BDE. Like, really has it. Here, we’re celebrating some of our favorite Aries celebrities who, without a doubt, possess serious quantities of BAE.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Taylor Hill/Getty Images</span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-1-reese-witherspoon></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>1. Reese Witherspoon</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Sure, Witherspoon, who’ll celebrate her birthday on March 22, might seem too sweet to fit the mold of the classic Aries. When you think “BAE,” you probably think reckless, stubborn, and even a little self-absorbed. And, frankly, we’d never use those words to describe the Big Little Lies producer and star. But, let it be known, she can still wield her BAE like a pro.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In her <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>involvement with Time’s Up</a> and work for equal pay at HBO, Witherspoon is showing how her fellow Aries women can exert their BAE subtly, confidently, and with maximum impact. To any Aries reading who doesn’t think they have BAE, take a page out of Reese’s book: You don’t have to be the most demanding diva in the room to show off your astrological clout.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-2-cynthia-nixon></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>2. Cynthia Nixon</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Anyone with a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>bagel order</a> like Nixon’s is flaunting some majorly unapologetic Big Aries Energy, but that’s merely one example of the <i>Sex and the City</i> star’s astrological identity. Nixon, whose birthday falls on April 9, has more than earned her Aries stripes for her <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>brash style</a>, political <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3>activism</a>, and her outspoken sass. We saw some stunning examples of said sass during her New York gubernatorial campaign in 2018 when she <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=4>called out “Cuomo’s MTA”</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=5>poked fun</a> at critics who described her as an “unqualified lesbian.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Where some Aries use their tenacity and seemingly bottomless energy for personal gain, Nixon uses hers to speak out about LGBTQ+ rights (for which <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>the Human Rights Campaign gave her the Visibility Award</a> in 2018) and other causes close to her heart. Whether as Miranda or as an activist, Nixon reminds us that BAE is iconic — and can be wielded as a force for good.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-3-diana-ross></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>3. Diana Ross</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">From her stunning talent to her glamorous style to her undeniably driven attitude, Ross, who was born on March 26, couldn’t belong to any sign but Aries. No one else in the Zodiac can come close to this level of cultural impact. Throughout her illustrious decades-long career, Ross has helped define the Motown sound and put soul music on the map, securing her reputation as one of the most influential women in music — and, in turn, a wielder of some serious BAE.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Like a true Aries, Ross is the embodiment of passion, courage, and the conviction that you can always work harder and get farther than anyone else. And, perhaps in a nod to her sign’s ruling planet, go-getter Mars, she’s given us some incredible motivational quotes to take to heart. This would have to be <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>our personal favorite</a>: "You can’t just sit there and wait for people to give you that golden dream, you’ve got to get out there and make it happen for yourself."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Daniele Venturelli/Getty Images</span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-4-sarah-jessica-parker></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>4. Sarah Jessica Parker</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When Parker was born on March 25, a very specific sort of BAE came into being. She isn't as demanding as Mariah and she isn't as out there as Celine, but, trust us, SJP would be considered to be just as "high maintenance" as those two — if she didn't go out of her way to maintain herself.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">From her <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Carrie-Bradshaw-approved shoe line</a> to her <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>sprawling Manhattan townhouse</a> to her expert form in shutting down the seemingly endless drama between her and Kim Catrall, Parker has made it quietly clear that she likes — no, needs — things her way. And, beyond that, she’s more than happy to be the one who ensures that things go her way. If we had to give an example of a hardworking diva, we’d point directly to SJP.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-5-saoirse-ronan></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>5. Saoirse Ronan</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_34-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">With an April 12 birthday, Ronan was born squarely in the middle of Aries season — and has the BAE to prove it. She earned an Oscar nomination for best supporting actress at the early age of 13 for <i>Atonement</i> and that was only the start of the actor’s accolades. Her career reflects the classically Aries ability to push ahead, blaze one’s own trail, and drive toward the success you know you deserve. When she was nominated again, this time for best lead actress, in 2016 for her work in <i>Brooklyn</i>, she <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>told InStyle </a><i>InStyle</i> that the film left her with a very Ram-like lesson: “This [film] is really about knowing how to say no, knowing to take a step back, and knowing what’s right for you.” If there ever was a sign that knew how to say know and self-advocate, it was most definitely Aries.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_36-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If we had to cite a single, definitive example of Ronan’s DGAF BAE, it would have to be <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>the response she gave to <i>Vogue</i></a> when asked how she successfully leapt out of a moving car in <i>Lady Bird</i>: “[I] just opened the door and did a drop and roll.” Frankly, we could never.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_38-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Edward Berthelot/Getty Images</span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-6-celine-dion></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_39-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>6. Celine Dion</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_40-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The infinitely meme-able chanteuse isn’t a total Aries because of her <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>“extra”</a> approach to fashion or her more-than-willingness to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>flaunt her vocal talents</a> at the drop of a hat (although those traits absolutely apply to the sign of the Ram). She’s an Aries because she does these things without a hint of self-consciousness. Dion, who will celebrate her 51st birthday on March 30, knows her strengths and is firmly confident in her personal style. After all, it’s her individuality that’s made her the star that she is.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_42-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Nothing can shake this woman, let alone persuade her to change her (admittedly very bold) stripes and risk dulling her shine. Besides, nothing is more BAE than wolfing down a hot dog while wearing a Met Gala gown.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-7-victoria-beckham></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_44-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>7. Victoria Beckham</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_45-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Frankly, we could point to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Beckham’s $790 “sex pants”</a> as both the source and best example of her BAE and leave it at that. But, when this multi-hyphenate star’s birthday rolls around on April 17, we’ll be celebrating her Aries identity as it appears across her life and work, for which she’s garnered awards from everyone from BBC Radio 4 to the literal British Empire (in true Aries style, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>she broke with tradition and humble-bragged about the honors</a>).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_47-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">It turns out that Beckham’s Posh Spice persona may have helped the young pop star feel more comfortable expressing her astrological identity. In October 2020, she <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>wrote about the nickname’s origins on Instagram</a>, noting, “I ultimately grew into it on my own terms. I was young and shy, and being Posh helped me find my style and confidence, and my voice.” It’s difficult to imagine Beckham being anything other than the driven trendsetter and pop culture icon she is today, running her fashion and beauty lines, and compelling us to adopt even the most questionable looks (seriously, only a sign as bold as Aries would casually step out in peep-toe, thigh-high boots).</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_49-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Kevin Mazur/Getty Images</span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-8-lady-gaga></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_50-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>8. Lady Gaga</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_51-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Untappable energy and ambition? Check. Balls-to-the-wall self-presentation? Check. Heroic honesty? <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Check, definitely</a>. Gaga is exactly who comes to mind when we think about Aries’ ruling element: fire. From her artistic passion to her huge commercial success, Gaga has been burning brightly since March 28, 1986.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_53-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">On a more superficial level, Gaga most visibly flaunts her Big Aries Energy in the fashion choices she’s made throughout her career. Rams are the risk-takers and trail-blazers of the Zodiac — there isn’t a trend or over-the-top look they won’t try at least once. This is not to say that every single Aries in your life should try wearing a meat dress to their next event (or maybe a Cinderella-inspired gown with a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>60-carat diamond necklace</a>), but, providing they possess adequate BAE, they’d probably pull it off.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-9-kourtney-kardashian></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_55-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>9. Kourtney Kardashian</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_56-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">At the risk of stating the stunningly obvious, Kourtney Kardashian does her own thing. She sets firm boundaries around the private details she shares on <i>Keeping Up With The Kardashians</i> (to the frustration of her sisters/co-stars), styles her kids exactly as they like (despite <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>shady remarks from Instagram followers</a>), and shuns any food that isn’t organic and gluten-free (though the jury is still out as to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>whether she knows what gluten is</a>). As you may have guessed, Kardashian makes her choices based on her wants and needs, critics be damned — and that devil-may-care attitude directly stems from her BAE.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_58-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When her birthday arrives on April 18, Kardashian will undoubtedly celebrate in a way that’s tailor-made for her discerning tastes and preferences, while we spend the day readying ourselves for another year of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Kourt being Kourt</a>.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-10-kristen-stewart></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_60-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>10. Kristen Stewart</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_61-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Although the notoriously private actress, born on April 9, might not seem like a natural candidate for the BAE hall of fame, look a little closer and you’ll find an Aries who speaks her mind and defines who she is on her terms alone. As she said in <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>a 2016 interview with the <i>New York Times Style Magazine</i></a>, "It's not that I want to hide who I am or hide anything I’m doing in my life. It’s that I don't want to become a part of a story for entertainment value." Far be it from any Aries to let someone else set their narrative.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_63-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Besides, anyone who’s been following Stewart’s red carpet appearances over the years already knows that she lets her rebellious BAE fly in her fashion choices. Whether she’s wearing <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Doc Martens to a Chanel show</a> or making messy, half-bleached hair work, Stewart is a total Aries, blazing her own style trail and leaving the rest of us in the dust.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-11-jennifer-garner></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_65-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>11. Jennifer Garner</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_66-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">From her badass performances in <i>Alias</i>, <i>Elektra</i>, and <i>Peppermint</i>, we already knew that Garner, born on April 17, was harboring some serious BAE beneath that sweet exterior. Beyond her penchant for action roles, we can see her fiery Ram tendencies in her work as <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>a member of Save the Children’s board of trustees</a> and in her campaigning to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>protect her children’s privacy</a> from the invasive treatment of celebrity media. She advocates for changes and causes she cares about fiercely and consistently. And, judging by <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>this heartening advice</a> she offered to a fan going through a difficult breakup, it’s safe to say she encourages others to fight, too.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_68-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Our confidence in Garner’s Aries bona fides only increased last year, when she posted <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>a truly iconic video</a> featuring her gorgeous laundry room, her indestructible cat, and a big glass of red wine. Not only does she fight for what she believes in and lifts up fans when they need it, but she can also crack a darn good joke.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-12-kate-hudson></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_70-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>12. Kate Hudson</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_71-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Born on April 19, Kate Hudson possesses a kind of honesty that goes hand-in-hand with BAE. Whether she’s <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>calling out Jimmy Fallo</a>n for his decades-old crush on her or speaking frankly about <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Matthew McConaughey’s kissing skills</a> (or lack thereof), she doesn’t hold back. The sign of the Ram doesn’t sugarcoat things, even if the truth is a little awkward or ugly. Luckily for Hudson, her signature sense of humor and breezy attitude prevent these moments of bluntness from seeming ill-intentioned. Instead, they’re playful barbs indicative of Aries’ outspoken nature.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_73-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">We’d be remiss if we didn’t also note Hudson’s oh-so-Aries-like commitment to her growing wellness empire with business ventures like King St. Vodka, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>INBLOOM supplements</a>, her <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>partnership with WW</a> (formerly known as Weight Watchers), and Fabletics, the activewear line she started with JustFab back in 2015. She <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3>proudly stated</a> that her film career had taken a backseat to her work with the brand in 2018 and she continues to drive Fabletics toward further success today, proving her business acumen in the process.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-13-reba-mcentire></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_75-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>13. Reba McEntire</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_76-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Let’s just say, modesty isn’t exactly an Aries’ first language. And, with her unabashed <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>pride in her talent and body of work</a>, this bombastic country star is without a doubt a dyed-in-the-wool Ram. To be fair, McEntire has plenty to brag about — the story goes that she <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>taught herself</a> how to play guitar as a child and has had quite clearly carried that early musical skill well into her life.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_78-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">But if this fiery redhead’s BAE were ever in doubt (and, honestly, how could you even question her bonafides?), look no further than her performance at the 2019 CMAs, which featured not one but two costume changes that left us onlookers positively floored. We can only assume that, when her birthday rolls around on March 28, she’ll don an equally dazzling getup.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-14-mariah-carey></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_80-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>14. Mariah Carey</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_81-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Between her <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>legendary “I don’t know her” admission</a> to her claim that she <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>“can’t read suddenly,”</a> Carey is arguably the greatest and grandest example of BAE on this list. A master of her own reality, Carey reflects every Aries’ belief that first place is the best place — and that you can either <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>go big or go home</a>. Her <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=4>five Grammys</a>, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=5>18 number-one hits</a>, and decades-long career is proof enough of that winner’s mentality, but Carey’s personal life, in which she lives by a bizarrely strict (and pricey) diet and once cleared out an entire hospital in order to give birth, is evidence that her diva reputation is anything but an act.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_83-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">One of Carey’s subtlest, yet longest-lasting, acts of divahood is the fact that no one — not even the all-knowing Wikipedia — knows the exact year she was born. Was it March 27, 1969 or 1970? That’s just for Mimi to know.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_85-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Jason Mendez/Getty Images</span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-15-lucy-lawless></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_86-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>15. Lucy Lawless</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_87-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Born on March 29, Lawless has made a name for herself playing strong women (she lent her voice to Wonder Woman in the animated movie Justice League: The New Frontier) who, more often than not, simply DGAF — and, as far as we can tell, we can say the same about Lawless herself. We know that she isn’t actually Xena, the iconic “warrior princess” she played on TV, but there’s no doubt that it takes a fearless, Mars-ruled Aries woman to embody such a powerful role.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_89-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If we had to point to a single, sign-defining moment for Lawless, it’d be back in 2012 when she and several other activists <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>were arrested</a> after staging a protest on board an oil-drilling ship. At the time, Lawless said in statement, “the story of the battle to save the Arctic has just begun.” As much as Rams tend to look out for number one, their fighting spirit cannot be denied.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57y6Kdnqukrrmme8CroJ6rXZiyrbHBq6CtoZWo</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./achraf-hakimi-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-106667-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Achraf Hakimi Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography">&larr;
