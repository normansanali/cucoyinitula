The actor is known for starring in numerous films and television series that went on to achieve the status of Hollywood blockbusters such as Escape, Rocky, and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Rambo</a>, to name a few.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=302 data-current-count=302 data-injectable=false>The actor has impressed his fans over many years with his brilliant performances and screen presence. Unlike his successful career, his personal and familial life has been tumultuous. This is mostly due to his multiple marriages and the loss of his eldest son, Sage, who died of a heart attack in 2012.</p><p data-characters=199 data-current-count=501 data-injectable=true>A discussion of Sylvester’s family life struggles would be incomplete without the mention of his younger son Seargeoh Sylvester. Let’s shine some light on the same and get to know more about him.</p><h2 id=h-what-do-we-know-about-seargeoh-stallone data-injectable=false>What do we know about Seargeoh Stallone?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Sylvester-Stallone-and-Seargeoh-Stallone-in-Rocky-II.jpg><p data-characters=93 data-current-count=393 data-injectable=false>Given Seargeoh’s famous father, there is more known about him than the average person.</p><p data-characters=235 data-current-count=628 data-injectable=true>Seargeoh was born in 1979 to Sylvester Stallone and his first wife Sasha Czack. Presently, he is 43 years old and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">has three half-sisters</a> from his father’s side, Sophia Rose Stallone, Sistine Rose Stallone, and Scarlet Rose Stallone.</p><p data-characters=242 data-current-count=242 data-injectable=false>They are the daughters of Stallone and his estranged wife Jennifer Flavin. He also has two nephews, Frank and Dante. Unfortunately, Seargeoh had to undergo his share of struggles after he was diagnosed with autism at the age of three in 1982.</p><p data-characters=452 data-current-count=694 data-injectable=true>At the time, his parents began to notice his lack of communication and socialization skills which wasn’t considered normal for children of his age. This was a highly concerning matter and both Stallone and Sasha took every measure to find a cure for their son’s problem. They sought assistance at the National Society for Children and Adults with Autism where they set up a research fund to find a suitable and permanent solution to the disability.</p><p data-characters=345 data-current-count=345 data-injectable=false>Eventually, Seargeoh’s parents got divorced in 1985 and his father tied the knot with Brigitte Nielsen the same year. During this time, his mother took care of him and she was going through his first stages of therapy, which continued for several years after which he was enrolled at a school for learning disabilities in Pasadena, California.</p><p data-characters=223 data-current-count=568 data-injectable=true>Speaking on this subject to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">People Magazine</a>, Sasha expressed the pain and the burden of responsibility with which she was assigned. She said, “I knew that Sly couldn’t get as involved because of his work,” says Sasha.</p><p data-characters=307 data-current-count=307 data-injectable=false>“We do what we have to do. So, I just said, ‘Give me the money, and I’ll take care of it.” Later, his father insisted on him staying with the family and engaging in homeschooling, which bore positive results by the time he turned ten — when his speech and social skills comparatively improved.</p><h2 id=h-seargeoh-stallone-s-role-in-rocky data-injectable=false>Seargeoh Stallone’s role in Rocky</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/image_a57ba5.png><p data-characters=376 data-current-count=376 data-injectable=false>Unlike his father and elder brother, Seargeoh’s condition did not permit him to establish his mark in the entertainment industry, though he did make an appearance in one of Sylvester’s most famous films. He made a small cameo in 1979 in the sports drama film Rocky II where he played Rocky Balboa Jr., the infant son of Rocky (starring his father) and Adriane Balboa.</p><p data-characters=269 data-current-count=645 data-injectable=true>The film was directed by Sylvester Stallone and produced by Robert Chertoff and Irwin Winkler. In 1982, he also appeared alongside his mom, dad, and brother on the cover of a magazine. Seargeoh did not make any media appearances after that, nor did he star in any film.</p><h2 id=h-what-is-seargeoh-up-to-now data-injectable=false>What is Seargeoh up to now?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Sylvester-Stallone-Family.jpg><p data-characters=340 data-current-count=640 data-injectable=true>At present, Seargeoh is <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">residing with his family</a> in their cozy and sprawling La Quinta mansion. Reports state that he lives with his mother, but that’s all anyone seems to know at best. His father and half-sisters can be seen on the Paramount Plus reality TV series, The Family Stallone, of which the first season premiered last year.</p><p data-characters=84 data-current-count=84 data-injectable=false>The show’s been a great success so far, heading into a greenlit second season.</p><p data-characters=322 data-current-count=406 data-injectable=true>Before the series premiere this past May, a little rumbling came about regarding Sylvester’s son, when he appeared to be missing from the show’s trailers and related marketing. This was something that was nearly instantly noticed by fans who follow Stallone closely, generating considerable buzz at that time.</p><p data-characters=147 data-current-count=147 data-injectable=false>However, this might make sense when you consider his relatively quiet upbringing, compared to all the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">buzz that followed his father</a> over the years.</p><p data-characters=339 data-current-count=486 data-injectable=false>There has been no other information revealed about Seargeoh’s whereabouts or dating life yet. And he’s hardly seen at all in public, especially with his famous father. Even though Seargeoh seems to be living a comfortable, secluded life, we hope to perhaps see him one day again on screen and in upcoming projects. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TEqbuMoqpmq5WWv6ixzqFkrKyRobmwusRmqrKkpprAtbHRZqqtmZyhvK%2Bx0maqqKZdlruledahnKudXa68tsLEZqqenZ5itaq5jg%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./lyrics-will-gittens-still-the-one.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Will gittens still the one lyrics">&larr;
