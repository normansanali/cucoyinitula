The R&B icon has been crushing the music scene since his debut back in 1994 when he was just 15 years old. Raymond has since become one of the biggest entertainers, sparking major interest in his personal life.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Following <a href=#>his first marriage to Tameka Foster</a> in 2007, Usher moved on to Grace Harry after his divorce in 2009. While it seemed as if Usher and Grace were picture-perfect, the duo split in 2018. Well, it seems as if the 'Confessions' singer didn't waste any time moving on, considering he was linked to his new girlfriend, Jennifer Goiceochea in 2019.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Usher And Other Celebs Who Named Their Kids After Themselves</a></span></p><p>The couple has been making headlines ever since, especially following the <a href=#>announcement of their first child together</a>. Well, congratulations are in order yet again as Jennifer and Usher welcomed their second baby! Considering she might be "the one" for Usher, as third time's always the charm, fans are eager to know more about Usher's leading lady.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=usher-and-jennifer-began-dating-in-2019>Usher And Jennifer Began Dating In 2019</h2><p>Usher has always been quite public when it comes to his romances, so his relationship with his current girlfriend, Jennifer Goicoechea was certainly no exception. The couple reportedly began dating back in October of 2019 and have been together ever since. The singer was previously married not once, but twice to both Tameka Foster and Grace Harry, however, fans feel as if his romance with Jenn is unlike any of his others.</p><p>The duo took things to the next level quite quickly into their relationship, announcing that Jennifer was pregnant with their first child together in early 2020. Come September 30 of that year, the duo welcomed a baby girl, Sovereign Bo Raymond. "We are feeling blessed and full of love with the arrival of our beautiful baby girl," Usher wrote on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">his Instagram.</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-is-a-music-executive-at-epic-records>She Is A Music Executive At Epic Records</h2><p>While we know Jennifer as Usher's girlfriend and baby mama, she's quite known within the music industry. Jennifer Goicoechea was the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">director of the rhythm and soul department at ASCAP</a>, which is a non-profit organization that works to protect its client's musical copyrights.</p><p>In addition to her former role at ASCAP, Goicoechea is now the Vice President of A&R at Epic Records, which is quite major! The label represents massive names in the music biz including Travis Scott, 21 Savage, Rick Ross, Mariah Carey, and Meghan Trainor, to name a few.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>'Confessions' Was Never Even About Usher's Relationships</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-two-welcomed-their-second-baby-together>The Two Welcomed Their Second Baby Together</h2><p>After two years together, it appears as if congratulations are in order once again for the happy couple!
