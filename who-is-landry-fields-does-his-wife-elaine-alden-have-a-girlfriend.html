It’s not just his father, Steve Fields, a A college basketball player when he was at the University of Miami, he also made the 1975 draft even though he was unable to appear in an NBA game.</span></p><p><span>The only thing that is more interesting than his father also playing in his youth is that his mother, Janice Fields was once a community college basketball player.&nbsp;A cousin of Cameron Jones, Landry also has members of his extended family who have played the sport.</span></p><p><span>For his education he went to Ellwood P. Cubberley Elementary School from where he proceeded to Stanford University where he continued to perform.&nbsp;Showcasing an outstanding performance, he was selected by the New York Knicks in the 2010 NBA draft.&nbsp;Prior to that, he made the All-Pac-10 first team and was named Pac-10 Scholar-Athlete of the Year.</span></p><p><span>At the end of his first season in the NBA, he earned the NBA All-Rookie First Team.&nbsp;Prior to that, he was the Rookie of the Month for November and December 2010 in the Eastern Conference.&nbsp;He remained with the Knickers until 2012 when he signed a three-year contract with the Toronto Raptors worth $20 million.</span></p><p><span>Unfortunately for him, he couldn’t make it big with the Raptors as he continued to struggle with injuries.&nbsp;When his contract ended, he went for another surgery which ruled him out for five months.&nbsp;As a result, he sat out the 2015–16 season, marking the end of his career.&nbsp;Still, he remained close to sports as he was named a college scout by the San Antonio Spurs.</span></p><p><span>Apart from basketball, he has also made a few television appearances.&nbsp;In 2011, he was part of&nbsp;</span><span>The Andy and Landry Show</span><span>&nbsp;which he ran with his former bandmate, Andy Rautins.&nbsp;The show didn’t last a year before it ended.&nbsp;Then he took part in a reality show on the&nbsp;</span><span>Chante ton visage</span><span>&nbsp;in 2014, and together with Lisa Rinna, he was named a finalist.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Who is his wife?&nbsp;Girlfriend</span></strong></h2><p><span>If you’re wondering if the ex-NBA star has a girlfriend, he doesn’t.&nbsp;He has been married since 2014 to his supermodel girlfriend, Elaine Alden.</span></p><p><span>Elaine, born on February 11, 1987, was first linked to Landry Fields in 2012 while still playing for the New York Knicks.&nbsp;The ex-basketballer first spotted the woman who would become his wife during an electronic dance music show and thanks to being in a band with a mutual friend, the two were introduced , kicking off what was to come.&nbsp;to lead to something big.</span></p><p><span>In 2013, the duo got engaged before becoming man and wife in 2014 at an event held on a rooftop overlooking a beautiful Gothic cathedral at Rockefeller Center.&nbsp;So far, the union has been blessed with two sons: Jackson James Fields, born a year before the couple married, and Kai David Fields, born in 2016.</span></p><p><span>Elaine Alden was a model before she got married and she appeared in some fitness videos but not much is known about her family or how she was raised.</span></p><h2><strong><span>the size</span></strong></h2><p><span>As a former basketball star, one of the things it’s easy to assume is that Landry Fields has an intimidating height.&nbsp;He deservedly has it as he stands at a huge height which measures 6 feet 6 inches (2.01m) and a body weight of 215 pounds (98 kg).</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGiZrrKqZL2mu8%2BlnGivmKR6qr%2BMpZinnKKueqe1xKWbrGWUpLK0eceiqmavmZuybrHLmqCnnV2WuaWxzWafmq6VYq5us8iro5%2BqmZq7pXs%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./pierce-brosnan-wife-keely-shaye-smith-everything-you-need-to-know.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is Pierce Brosnan's wife of 20 years, Keely Shaye Smith?
