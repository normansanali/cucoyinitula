So, recently, they penciled in some soccer fields as well.</p><p>But the Edison Park plan approved last week by the Community and Library Services Commission — which would also add pickleball courts, a dog park and a pump track for bike riders — also would erase a chunk of leafy open space. And as residents learned about that, several spoke up in defense of something that would go away — trees.&nbsp; .</p><ul data-total=8><li data-index=1 readability=3><img data-sizes=auto style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ocregister.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/OCR-L-HBEDISON-1118-JG-08.jpg><p class=slide-caption>Mature trees fill Edison Park in Huntington Beach, CA, on Wednesday, November 17, 2021.

Their needs have to be met. But so do (the needs of those who) want to enjoy green open space. We don’t have a lot of it left.”</p><p>Several AYSO supporters, meanwhile, extolled the virtues of soccer as a welcoming youth program in which, famously, “everyone plays.”</p><p>“South Huntington Beach AYSO serves 1,600 kids a year with over 200 volunteers,” said Region 56 commissioner Ann McCarthy. “All kids play, regardless of skill and ability. But we have fewer fields than any other (Orange County) city of comparable size.”</p><p>Before the heartfelt testimonials began, city staff already had gone back to the drawing board – hastily affixing an alternative conceptual plan to the agenda. “Option C”&nbsp; rubbed out 57 parking spaces, which would rescue some 20 large trees.</p><p>“After the agenda came out, we heard a lot of concerns from neighbors,” said Chris Slama, director of community services for Huntington Beach. “We wanted to be responsive.”</p><p>At the end of the long meeting, the council unanimously approved the revised rendering.</p><p>“Thank you for listening to residents and making some changes,” Councilman Erik Peterson told Slama.</p><p>The soccer field crisis started brewing in 2019, when Huntington Beach City School District decided to sell its site that once housed Gisler Middle School – shuttered in 1986, and later occupied by and Brethren Christian School. The 14-acre property on Srathmoor Lane holds two full-sized, lighted soccer fields – the only ones in Region 56.</p><p>On Oct. 19, the City Council unanimously OKed the development of a residential tract on the property. Brookfield Homes, which bought the land from the district for $42 million, plans to build 85 single-family houses there.</p><p>Brookfield has pledged $500,000 to find a different site for lit soccer fields.</p><p>Should the Edison Park conceptual plan survive as currently imagined, three 50-yard by 70-yard youth-sized soccer fields will be added to a strip of land along Hamilton Avenue. Owned by Southern California Edison, the grassy area sits underneath power lines.</p><p>Two more soccer fields would share grass with existing softball fields.</p><p>Option C also ditches the off-leash dog area.</p><p>The city promises to plant 200 trees, more than replenishing those that will be felled.</p><p>Even so, some grumble, it will take decades for the saplings to fill the shoes of the tall, shady veterans there today. Residents continue to complain on social media about the impending death of beautiful trees.</p><p>“The environmental impact is massive, and it’s going to have a huge ripple effect,” wrote one critic, listing the multiple bird species that nest or rest in the park.</p><p>In Tuesday’s meeting, Councilman Mike Posey argued that the city is “planning for future generations.”</p><p>“People say, ‘We don’t want those 50-year-old trees cut down,” he said. “But in 50 years, trees we plant now will be 50 years old.”</p><p><a href=#>This post first appeared on ocregister.com</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue82erqxnmanAbr%2FOnJqeql2rwG7A0Z6crGWRqXqmsMispqdloJa%2FrHnAp5tmrJiaerW%2BxJ6qZqWZnLW1edaipWg%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./james-hillier.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="James Hillier">&larr;
