Videos from this party have been posted across social media, showing hundreds of people without masks in the Sway House.</p><p>Many were quick to criticize Bryce and the Sway House members, as the party did not follow social distancing guidelines. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Insider</a>, the Los Angeles police department attempted to shut down the party at 4 a.m., citing that it broke the city's social distancing guidelines.</p><p>According to @DefNoodles, this was not the first party held at the Sway House in recent months, and was their third party within four days.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Bryce Hall and Sway House throw massive party in Hollywood Hills with over a hundred people.
