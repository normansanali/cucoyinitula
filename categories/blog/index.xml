Pain - without love,
Pain - I can't get enough.
Pain - I like it rough,
'Cause I'd rather feel pain than nothing at all.[Verse 1]
You're sick of feeling numb,
You're not the only one.
I'll take you by the hand,
And I'll show you a world that you can understand.
This life is filled with hurt,
When happiness doesn't work.
Trust me and take my hand,
When the lights go out you will understand.</description></item><item><title>'Cruel Summer' Is Back and Better Than Ever!
