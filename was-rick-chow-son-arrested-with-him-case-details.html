Netizens have wondered if&nbsp; Rick Chow Son was also involved in this case. Find out more details in the article below.</strong></p><p>A tragic incident occurred on Sunday night in Columbia, South Carolina, when a 14-year-old boy was shot and killed by a convenience store owner who mistakenly thought he had stolen some water bottles.</p><p>&nbsp;The boy, Cyrus Carmack-Belton, was reportedly armed with a gun but did not pose any threat to the store owner, Rick Chow, or his son, who chased him down the street.</p><p>According to authorities, Cyrus Carmack-Belton had a verbal altercation with Chow inside the Xpress Mart store, but he did not take anything from the store.</p><h2>Was Rick Chow Son Arrested With Him? Case Details&nbsp;</h2><p>Unfortunately, there is not much information about what happened to&nbsp; Rick Chow son after the tragic accident. However, Rick Chow was arrested for the murder of Carmack-Belton.</p><p>On Sunday night, May 28, 2023, a 14-year-old boy named Cyrus Carmack-Belton was shot and killed by a convenience store owner who mistakenly believed he was stealing four bottles of water.</p><p>&nbsp;The incident took place at Chow’s Xpress Mart Shell station in Columbia, South Carolina, and has sparked outrage and grief among the community.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthypeeps.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/NYPICHPDPICT000011947451.jpg><p>According to the Richland County Sheriff’s Department, the store owner, Rick Chow, 58, confronted Carmack-Belton inside the store and accused him of shoplifting.</p><p>Carmack-Belton tried to run away, but Chow and his son chased him. Chow then fired his gun at the teen, hitting him in the chest. Carmack-Belton was pronounced dead at the scene.</p><p>The police found no evidence that Carmack-Belton had stolen anything from the store. They also found a gun near his body, but there was no indication that he ever pointed it at Chow or his son.</p><p>Chow was arrested and charged with murder. This was not the first time that Chow had resorted to violence against suspected shoplifters.</p><p>In fact, he had shot at two other people in separate incidents in 2015 and 2018, but he was never charged because his actions were deemed as self-defense.</p><p>In both cases, the shoplifters had assaulted Chow or threatened to shoot him before he fired his weapon. However, in this case, the sheriff said that Chow’s use of lethal force was unjustified.</p><p>You May Also Read: <a href=#>USC Beaufort Associate Professor Brett Borton Obituary Death Cause And Family</a></p><h2>Rick Chow Murdered Victim – Cyrus Carmack-Belton</h2><p>Chow was arrested on Monday and charged with the murder of the boy identified as Cyrus Carmack-Belton.
