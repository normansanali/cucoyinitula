He had never won a major, though, and was dubbed the “best golfer never to win a major” in golf circles at the time.

He was ranked second on the ‘Official World Golf Ranking’ list in 2007 after winning the ‘Masters’ in 2006, his third major championship. The title was the pinnacle of his professional career.</p><p>Furthermore, the golfer was on track to become the only player to win three majors in a row, joining Tiger Woods and Ben Hogan. His performance, on the other hand, dipped at the 2006 ‘US Open’ at Winged Foot, when he tied for second place with Geoff Ogilvy, one shot back.</p><p>In 2007, he beat Tiger Woods by two strokes to win the Deutsche Bank Championship. The next year, he won the ‘Crowne Plaza Invitational’ at Colonia, defeating Tim Clark and Rod Pampling. At the WGC–CA Championship in 2009, he won his first ‘World Golf Championship’ by one shot over Nick Watney.
