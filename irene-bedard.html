Bedard’s life, ironically, was not as legendary as the character she played.</p><p>It’s equally heartbreaking and upsetting that women like Irene’s happiness and promising Hollywood career were ruined by none other than her own husband, Deni Wilson, a musician with whom she married in 1993 and has a son named Quinn Wilson, born in 2003.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/popularnetworth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Irene-Bedard.jpg><p>Bedard and Wilson had formed a band called Irene Bedard and Deni and toured across the country at the height of their relationship. Unfortunately, the truth behind the curtain was something far more horrifying and heartbreaking.</p><p>Mr. Wilson allegedly abused Bedard physically, mentally, and sexually, according to statements and letters shared by Bedard’s family. What’s more, the actress suffered throughout their seventeen-year marriage, which lasted nearly two decades.</p><h2>Wilson not only abused Bedard, but he also had control over her career and finances.</h2><p>Alia Davis, Bedard’s niece, revealed in a letter that Irene was only allowed to work on films and shows that favored Wilson. And, without his permission, Bedard refused to take any roles.</p><p>Furthermore, the scars and marks of the wounds left by Wilson’s constant abuse were often so visible to the people at her work that she was often disbanded from the roles because the filmmakers didn’t allow her to work with bruises on her body.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/64.media.tumblr.com/6d189b3bb5040d4a1261b4340dbcdfd2/tumblr_inline_o14xvzokbW1qhknuy_640.jpg><p>Wilson wouldn’t let the actress work without his presence on the set of the films, and he would even follow Bedard around as he worked. This also irritated the members of the film crew, who didn’t seem to want him there.</p><p>Not to mention that Wilson had complete control over Bedard’s earnings and finances, and he shamelessly took the money she earned from her work. And, when her health deteriorated to the point where she couldn’t function normally, her doctors, who were unaware of Bedard’s abuse allegations, began testing her for cancer.</p><p>Irene only stayed with her abusive husband because of her young son. It wasn’t until 2010, after seventeen years of enduring the abuse, that Irene decided to flee domestic violence scenarios with her seven-year-old son.</p><h2>Bedard’s battle with the Court should enrage you.</h2><p>Bedard and her son relocated from Ohio to Alaska, where the rest of her family was already settled. And it wasn’t until she gathered the courage, with the help of her family, that she filed for divorce and filed lawsuits against Wilson. In fact, it wasn’t until her court battle that her stories were made public.</p><p>Sure, she was able to get rid of her abusive husband, but the outcome of the court battle was far from satisfactory and happy for the victim and her family. What happened was a failure on the part of Bedard’s lawyers to win the case on behalf of truth.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/popularnetworth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Irene-Bedard-2-768x1024.jpg><p>Because the court decision caused Bedard to apply the rule of compliance, Wilson received no punishment because he accused his wife of lying because there was no visible evidence of the abuse. The worst wasn’t over yet. Bedard had to leave Alaska right away and fly to Ohio, where Wilson lived, to face the court.</p><p>She would have been imprisoned if she hadn’t. Not to mention that Wilson was given custody of their son.&nbsp;To this day, nearly a decade later, the Indian American woman has yet to speak publicly about her abuse stories.</p><p>Bedard, on the other hand, has collaborated with a number of organizations that work to raise awareness about domestic violence.&nbsp;We sincerely hope that Irene Bedard was able to overcome her traumatic past and continues to inspire other women and Native Americans.</p><p>You may also like: <a href=# rel=bookmark>Courtney Laine Mazza</a>, <a href=# rel=bookmark>Jennifer Landon</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmion6XCra3Rp5ytr5%2Bnwal6wqikaKGimrumecGem5qqlGQ%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./jason-blum-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jason Blum Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography">&larr;
