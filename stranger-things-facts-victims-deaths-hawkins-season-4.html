From the risk of getting stuck in the Upside Down to being controlled by the Mind Flayer, it's all kicking off in Stranger Things, which saw an explosive ending to its third season.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fans have been lost without the show, which has taken three years to make and announce its fourth season, which Stranger Things cast member Finn Wolfhard said is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">“easily the scariest and darkest” season yet.</a></p><p>Part one of Stranger Things 4 will be <a href=#>streaming on Netflix on May 27, 2022,</a>, with part two arriving on July 1.</p><p>Stranger Things started with Will Byers, a 12-year-old boy, encountering a creature from the Upside Down and mysteriously vanishing.</p><p>His three friends, Mike, Dustin, and Lucas, go looking for him and instead encounter Eleven, a girl with remarkable powers, and it soon becomes clear that she is the only one who can match the power of the Demogorgon and save Hawkins from the horror its currently living in.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>‘Stranger Things' Fans Caught This Demogorgon Mistake</a></span></p><p>The story is set in November 1983 in the fictional town of Hawkins in Indiana and has followed the childhoods of Mike, Eleven, Dustin, Lucas, and other teens who have been thrown into the mix and accidentally become heroes.</p><h2 id=victims-in-39-stranger-things-39-have-an-odd-similarity>Victims In 'Stranger Things' Have An Odd Similarity</h2><p>But sadly, not everyone who has met the Demogorgon or the Mind Flayer has survived, one of the saddest deaths being Bob Newby getting killed by Demodogs when he was mere inches away from freedom.</p><p>It turns out that one eagle-eyed fan has spotted something about the other victims in Hawkins, and took to Reddit to warn everybody: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">stay away from Hawkins if your first name starts with "B"!</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Bob Newby isn't the only unfortunate victim of the horrors hidden in Hawkins whose name begins with "B". There's also Benny Hammond, who was shot by government agents.</p><p>Then there's Barb Holland, who was killed by the Demogorgon in the first season, Bruce Lowe, who was taken over by the Mind Flayer and bludgeoned with a fire extinguisher by Nancy Wheeler, and finally, Billy Hargrove, who managed to escape being controlled by the Mind Flayer in time to sacrifice himself for Eleven.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>How Much Is Millie Bobby Brown Earning From 'Stranger Things' Now?</a></span></p><p>"Before anyone mentioned Eleven's aunt, Becky Ives," said the Redditor who noticed this odd pattern, "remember that she lives in Bloomington."</p><p>"Protect Beve Harrington at all costs," one Redditor joked.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"And his best friend Bustin too!" another replied. "My name begins with a B… gulp," a Redditor commented.</p><p>"Who is next on our list of b's," another Redditor asked.</p><h2 id=can-we-expect-more-monsters-in-39-stranger-things-39-season-4>Can We Expect More Monsters In 'Stranger Things' Season 4?</h2><p>Stranger Things 4 trailers have already teased a new boss, a creature called Vecna, who the show's creators (the Duffer brothers) have said was inspired by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">iconic horror figures such as Pinhead, Freddie Krueger, and Pennywise.</a></p><p>Robert Englund, the actor who played Freddie Krueger, will also have a <a href=#>recurring role, but it is unknown how many episodes he will be featured in.</a></p><p>Knowing such a horror icon will be in Stranger Things 4 is a scary thought, but fans can draw comfort from knowing they will see their favorite characters again soon, including Eleven, who <a href=#>fans thought looked like a mini Joyce in a season 4 sneak peek.</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Another new creature that sounds deceptively unscary is the Demo-Bats. It turns out they're a lot more dangerous and terrifying than they sound.</p><p>"Maybe one of them alone is not very dangerous, but when there’s hundreds and hundreds of them coming to you at the same time, they’re very, very deadly," Matt Duffer told IGN, "and they also have the ability to act as spies, so you may not even see one in the tree, and it spies you, and then suddenly because everything is a hive mind in The Upside Down, every monster in there knows that you’re there."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=fans-have-predicted-who-will-die-next-in-39-stranger-things-39>Fans Have Predicted Who Will Die Next In 'Stranger Things'</h2><p>It's safe to say that Stranger Things fans will most likely become heartbroken after watching the highly-anticipated series, and the Reddit "B" theory won't be enough the keep fans' favorite characters safe. Fans have already taken to Reddit again to predict who will die next in Stranger Things.</p><p>"Eleven will die to end the show," one Redditor has predicted. "Don’t want it to happen, but that’s my prediction."</p><p>One Redditor cleverly broke down which of the main cast was likely most safe from a death scene and why, leaving them with three names that could be used to pull the heartstrings of long-time fans: "In the end it would end up with Steve, Dustin & Nancy," the Redditor predicted.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Why Casting Winona Ryder In 'Stranger Things' Was So Important</a></span></p><p>"Will, Joyce, Eleven, Mike, and Hopper have immunity. Will's already been through enough, they wouldn't fake Hopper's death just to kill him for real later on, Eleven's too important to the plot, and Finn and Winona are too popular IRL to lose from the cast," one Redditor confidently stated. "Anyone else? Fair game."</p><p>If Season 4 is the darkest season yet as has been promised, then fans will surely expect some gruesome deaths at the hands of an exciting but terrifying new villain. New characters should be introduced too - let's just hope none of them have a name beginning with "B".</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Why Dacre Montgomery Is More Like His 'Stranger Things' Character Than Fans Think</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiqraqRo7Smvoytn6Kml6h6p63CrapmrpmYwaq50mabnpmkncButMCwoqKmo2LApq3SqKVmbF8%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./barefoot-contessa-7-ina-gartens-veggie-packed-dishes-halloween-candy-hangover-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="7 of Ina Garten's Veggie-Packed Dishes for That Halloween Candy Hangover">&larr;
