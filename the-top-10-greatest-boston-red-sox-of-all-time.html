From iconic sluggers to dominant pitchers, the Red Sox have produced some of the game's finest talents. In this article, we will take a closer look at the top 10 greatest Boston Red Sox of all time.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>1. Ted Williams</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>Ted Williams, also known as "The Splendid Splinter," is widely regarded as the greatest Red Sox player of all time. The left-handed outfielder spent his entire 19-year career with the Red Sox, amassing a staggering .344 batting average, 521 home runs, and a remarkable .482 on-base percentage. Williams was a 19-time All-Star and won two American League MVP awards. His dedication to hitting and unparalleled skills at the plate make him an undisputed legend.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>2. Carl Yastrzemski</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>Carl Yastrzemski, often referred to as "Yaz," had an illustrious career with the Red Sox from 1961 to 1983. He was a versatile player who excelled both offensively and defensively. Yastrzemski won the Triple Crown in 1967, becoming the last player to achieve this feat until Miguel Cabrera in 2012. Throughout his career, he amassed 3,419 hits, 452 home runs, and 1,844 runs batted in. Yastrzemski was a 18-time All-Star and a key figure in the Red Sox's success during the 1960s and 1970s.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>3. Pedro Martinez</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>Pedro Martinez, a Dominican-born pitcher, is widely regarded as one of the most dominant pitchers in baseball history. During his seven seasons with the Red Sox from 1998 to 2004, Martinez won three Cy Young Awards and led the team to a World Series victory in 2004. His electric fastball and devastating changeup made him nearly unhittable at times. Martinez finished his Red Sox career with a 117-37 record, a 2.52 ERA, and 1,683 strikeouts.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>4. David Ortiz</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>Affectionately known as "Big Papi," David Ortiz is one of the most beloved figures in Red Sox history. The designated hitter played a crucial role in the team's success, especially during their World Series championships in 2004, 2007, and 2013. Ortiz hit 541 home runs as a Red Sox player, second only to Ted Williams in franchise history. His clutch hitting and charismatic personality endeared him to fans and solidified his status as a Red Sox legend.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>5. Cy Young</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>Cy Young, the man for whom the prestigious Cy Young Award is named after, had a remarkable career with the Red Sox. Young was a dominant pitcher during the early 1900s and still holds the record for the most career wins with 511. He spent eight seasons with the Red Sox, winning 192 games and posting a 2.00 ERA. Young's dominance on the mound helped establish the Red Sox as a formidable team in the early years of the franchise.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>6. Jim Rice</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>Jim Rice played his entire 16-year career with the Red Sox and was one of the most feared hitters of his era. The power-hitting outfielder was a force to be reckoned with, amassing 382 home runs, 1,451 runs batted in, and a .298 batting average. Rice won the American League MVP award in 1978 and was an eight-time All-Star. His contributions to the Red Sox's success during the late 1970s and 1980s make him a deserving member of this list.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>7. Carlton Fisk</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>Carlton Fisk, a legendary catcher, played 11 seasons with the Red Sox from 1969 to 1980. Fisk was known for his power hitting and strong defensive skills behind the plate. His most memorable moment came in Game 6 of the 1975 World Series when he hit a walk-off home run to force a Game 7 against the Cincinnati Reds. Fisk finished his Red Sox career with 351 home runs and 1,276 runs batted in. He was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 2000.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>8. Wade Boggs</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>Wade Boggs, a third baseman, spent 11 seasons with the Red Sox from 1982 to 1992. Boggs was a hitting machine, consistently posting high batting averages and leading the league in hitting on multiple occasions. He won five batting titles as a Red Sox player and finished his career with a .328 batting average. Boggs was a key contributor to the Red Sox's success during the 1980s and earned a place in the Hall of Fame in 2005.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>9. Dustin Pedroia</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>Dustin Pedroia, a second baseman, spent his entire 14-year career with the Red Sox from 2006 to 2019. Despite his relatively small stature, Pedroia was known for his grit, determination, and exceptional defensive skills. He won the American League Rookie of the Year award in 2007 and went on to win the AL MVP award in 2008. Pedroia was a four-time Gold Glove winner and played a vital role in the Red Sox's World Series championships in 2007 and 2013.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>10. Roger Clemens</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>Roger Clemens, a dominant pitcher, spent 13 seasons with the Red Sox from 1984 to 1996. Clemens won three Cy Young Awards as a Red Sox player and established himself as one of the most feared pitchers of his generation. He finished his Red Sox career with a 192-111 record, a 3.06 ERA, and 2,590 strikeouts. Despite his controversial departure from the team, Clemens' accomplishments on the mound cannot be overlooked.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>The Boston Red Sox have been fortunate to have some of the greatest players in baseball history don their iconic uniform. From Ted Williams to David Ortiz, these players have left an indelible mark on the franchise and have become legendary figures in the hearts of Red Sox fans. Their contributions to the team's success and their individual achievements make them worthy of being considered the top 10 greatest Boston Red Sox of all time.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiekaOus6%2FHZ5qopV%2BXubCz0mikpZpfqbWmedOop2ZpYGK0s7HArZysrF2XvLTAzqdkq52UYsCwxIyonWaZnKF6tbXMng%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./what-is-tracy-morgans-net-worth-in-2024.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What is Tracy Morgan's Net Worth in 2024?">&larr;
