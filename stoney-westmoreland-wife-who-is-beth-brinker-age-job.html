Well, this certainly raised a lot of questions — one of which included who was Stoney’s wife Beth Brinker.</span></p><p><span>So, if you’re one of those enthusiasts eager to learn about Stoney’s wife, especially her age and job, you’ve come to the right place.</span></p><h3><b>Meet Stoney Westmoreland Wife, Beth Brinker</b></h3><p><span>Beth Brinker was Stoney Westmoreland’s wife for years. After spending most of their time in Kingsport, Tennessee (Stoney’s hometown), the two moved to Marina Del Rey, California only in mid-2010.</span></p><p><span>But the duo led a private life. They were so secretive that fans never noticed Beth alongside her husband Stoney in any events and functions.</span></p><p><span>Because of this, many reputable sites such as “</span><a href=#><span>biographymask.com</span></a><span>” rather believed Sharn Pavon to be Stoney’s wife.</span></p><h3><b>Are Stoney Westmoreland And Beth Brinker Still Married?</b></h3><p><span>No, Beth Brinker and Stoney Westmoreland aren’t married. The two were separated before 2021.</span></p><p><span>Sadly, we do not know when they exactly divorced. But we do know that they were still married in 2010.</span></p><p><span>This also means that Beth could have still been with Stoney when he was arrested back in Dec 2018, charged with “attempting to lure a 13-year-old into sex.” At the time, Utah prosecutors charged Stoney with six felony counts — one second-degree felony count of enticing a minor by internet or text, four three-degree felony counts of dealing in materials harmful to a minor, and one third-degree felony count of attempted sexual exploitation of a minor.</span></p><p><span>According to the reports, Stoney began conversing with a 13-year-old male and asked if that boy would come to his hotel room and engage in se*ual activity. Furthermore, the cast detective also stated that the actor allegedly sent se*ually explicit photos and was arrested when he arrived at the location of who he believed was the teen.</span></p><p><span>After the controversy, Disney Channel released Stoney from his recurring role on the series </span><i><span>Andi Mack</span></i><span>, where he played grandfather Henry “Ham” Mack. “Given the nature of the charges and our responsibility for the welfare of employed minors, we have released him from his recurring role and he will not be returning to work on the series,” their official statement read.</span></p><p><span>Fast forward to June 2022, six months after being charged with multi-felonies, Stoney was then finally sentenced to two years behind bars and 10 years of supervised release.</span></p><p><span>Reportedly, Stoney had struck up a deal with prosecutors and pleaded guilty to a lesser charge of using interstate facilities to transmit information about a minor. A part of the deal also stated that Stoney must cooperate with DNA collection and register as a sex offender. Furthermore, his computer devices (including email and social media) would also be subjected to random search and inspections.</span></p><p><span>Also, the actor was restricted from any type of contact with individuals who are under 18 years of age without adult supervision.</span></p><h3><b>How Many Kids Do Beth Brinker And Stoney Westmoreland Have?</b></h3><p><span>Beth Brinker and Stoney Westmoreland share a daughter named Tennesee Westmoreland.</span></p><p><span>They welcomed her on February 11, 1996.</span></p><h3><b>Beth Brinker Age</b></h3><p><span>Beth Brinker was 53 years of age in 2022.</span></p><p><span>She is a year older than her husband Stoney Westmoreland who was born on March 18, 1970.</span></p><h3><b>Beth Brinker Job</b></h3><p><span>Beth Brinker is an art director. Though she might not be as popular as Stoney, she was quite well known among the off-screen professionals. One of her works includes the short 12 mins film </span><i><span>He Kindly Stopped</span></i><span> (2012). The movie was about a pair of traveling partners who reminisce about the choices they made and what it meant to truly be alive.</span></p><p><span>The last we checked, Beth was involved with </span><i><span>Mix Movie</span></i><span>.</span></p><h3><b>Beth Brinker Family</b></h3><p><span>Beth Brinker comes from a family of five.</span></p><p><span>Sadly, both of his parents have passed away. Her father, Gary Lee Brinker left this world on January 11, 2021, at the age of 81. He was a former FBI and US Navy who went on to teach at a high school in Eaton, Ohio.</span></p><p><span>As for Beth’s mother, Jean Ann Brinker, she took her last breath on July 3, 2010. She passed away after a long battle with cancer. This loving soul was a </span><i><span>Lewisburg High School</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Wilmington College</span></i><span> graduate who went on to work for over 20 years at </span><i><span>Ohio Turnpike Commission</span></i><span>.</span></p><p><span>Talking about Beth’s siblings, her older brother Scott Brinker is a former teacher who taught at </span><i><span>Fairfield County Education Service Center, Multi-County Juvenile Detention Center, Circleville Juvenile Correctional Facility</span></i><span>, and more.
