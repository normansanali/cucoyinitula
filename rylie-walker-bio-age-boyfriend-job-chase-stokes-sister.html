What are the odds?</p><p style=text-align:left>Baby sister Rylie had apparently surprised him during filming in South Carolina. The fact is, Chase’s post had led some people on his IG to wrongly assume Rylie as his new love interest following his breakup with his co-star Madelyn Cline in 2021.</p><p style=text-align:left>That being established, here’s a tell-all about Chase Stokes’s sister Rylie Walker.</p><h3 style=text-align:left><strong>Meet Rylie Walker, Chase Stokes Sister</strong></h3><p style=text-align:left>Rylie Walker is Chase Stokes’s half-sister. She shares the same father with him.</p><p style=text-align:left>First, Chase was born on 16 September 1992 in&nbsp;Annapolis, Maryland. He is the only child of Jeff Stokes and Jennifer Canning. His parents then divorced when he was several months old.</p><p style=text-align:left>Infant Chase naturally moved with his mother to Atlanta, Georgia, and later to Orlando, Florida as a teenager. Sometime in the process of growing up, both his parents got married to other spouses. And that is how Rylie came along, from Chase’s dad’s second marriage.</p><p style=text-align:left>Rylie has an additional sibling born from both her parents, therefore a full sibling. It is her “genius baby brother” Griffin Walker, who in Rylie’s words despite being younger is wiser. He graduated from Phillips Exeter Academy in June 2021.</p><p>Then there are Kaden Stokes and Kendall Nicole as well, Chase’s half-siblings, younger brother, and younger sister, with whom he has the same mum.</p><h3 style=text-align:left><strong>Does Rylie Walker Have A Boyfriend?</strong></h3><p>Rylie Walker has reportedly been dating Lewis Scattergood, a soccer player.</p><p>Lewis could not be found on Rylie’s social media and also no details of their relationship were understood as of the time of this writing.</p><p>So, for now, let us share with you some facts about Rylie’s alleged boyfriend. Unlike Rylie, Lewis was born and bred in his hometown of Nottinghamshire, England. The athletic man played soccer during high school at Outwood Academy Valley and later in college as well. Speaking of his educational background, the above 6-foot-1-inch 2022 Men’s Soccer Roster took a Sports Business major at college.</p><h3><strong>Rylie Walker Age</strong></h3><p>Rylie, with the full name Nora Mae Rylie Walker, was reportedly born in 2000. So, she likely turned 22 years old in 2022.</p><h3 style=text-align:left><strong>Rylie Walker Job</strong></h3><p>As per LinkedIn, Rylie Walke is searching for employment in marine biology and conservation as in May 2022 he was supposed to graduate from college. Since August 2018, she has been studying Bachelor of Applied Science focused in Marine and Aquatic Biology/Limnology and a Sustainable Food Systems minor.</p><p>Before that, from 2014 through 2018, Rylie also was a high schooler at Timber Creek High School.</p><p>In the meantime, Rylie had been working as a retail salesperson at Atlantic Scuba since June 2020. So, on LinkedIn, she also introduced herself as an experienced, hands-on retail salesperson with a demonstrated history of working in multiple industries. She also marked sustainability practices, environmental awareness and advocacy, marine biology, laboratory and research applications, and political ecology, as her skills.</p><p>(Of course) some of the media outlets also addressed her as a model.</p><h3 style=text-align:left><strong>Is Rylie Walker On TikTok?</strong></h3><p>Rylie Walker could be found on TikTok <a href=#>@ryliewalk</a>. However, she did not share much on it and also did not have many followers. On Instagram though, her account <a href=#>@ryliewalk</a><span style=font-size:15px;letter-spacing:-.01em> 57.9K followers saw her on an everyday basis. Here, she basically appears to be a nature</span> enthusiast. Even her BIO read “Girl on Planet Earth.” The social media sharings most of the time are also of her brother Chase and other siblings.</p><h3 style=text-align:left><strong>Rylie Walker Height</strong></h3><p>Rylie Walker stands below 5′ 5″ tall in height.</p><h3 style=text-align:left><strong>Related FAQs</strong></h3><ul style=text-align:left><li><h4><strong>When Is Rylie Walker’s Birthday?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Rylie Walker celebrates her birthday on the 8th of February. For people born on this day, the Zodiac sign is Aquarius.</p><ul style=text-align:left><li><h4><strong>Where Does Rylie Walker Live?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Rylie Walker is now based in DeLand, Florida. While her hometown is <span style=font-size:15px;letter-spacing:-.01em>Florida’s Orlando. Then, in a story about Chase, reporters claimed that his father, stepmom, and siblings </span>still reside in Maryland.</p><p style=text-align:left>Chase, on the other hand, had moved to Los Angeles, California with his then-girlfriend in 2017. And, before that, he had also lived in other cities during his early modeling and acting career.</p><ul><li><h4 style=text-align:left><strong>How Much Is Rylie Walker’s Net Worth?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>As per the U.S.News, someone like Rylie Walker, working as a retail salesperson, made a median salary of $27,080 from working over a year.</p><p>A retail salesperson job is more of a summer or part-time or a second job. So, at this point, Rylie is working likely to attain his basic financial independence rather than accumulate net worth for the future.</p><p>So, in the meantime, we can tell how much her brother Chase has as his net worth. Well, according to Pop Buzz, Stokes had $650,000 last year. And this, at the time, made him the second richest cast member of Outer Banks; the first richest being his ex-girlfriend, Madelyn Cline.</p>Total 0 Shares <a href=# class=pk-share-buttons-link><i class="pk-share-buttons-icon pk-icon pk-icon-facebook"></i> <span class="pk-share-buttons-label pk-font-primary">Share</span> <span class="pk-share-buttons-count pk-font-secondary">0</span></a> <a href=# class=pk-share-buttons-link><i class="pk-share-buttons-icon pk-icon pk-icon-twitter"></i> <span class="pk-share-buttons-label pk-font-primary">Tweet</span> <span class="pk-share-buttons-count pk-font-secondary">0</span></a> <a href=# class=pk-share-buttons-link><i class="pk-share-buttons-icon pk-icon pk-icon-pinterest"></i> <span class="pk-share-buttons-label pk-font-primary">Pin it</span> <span class="pk-share-buttons-count pk-font-secondary">0</span></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifn6jAqrzNnq%2BtnJ%2Bkv2%2BvzqZmq7GcnrJuw8Clop6qXZe2sHnAoJxmmp%2Bus7O1xKebZqKfl3qktMCsnGarpKS4pr%2BMrKCsrJWnfA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./why-are-travis-scott-sneakers-so-expensive.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Why are Travis Scott Sneakers so Expensive?">&larr;
