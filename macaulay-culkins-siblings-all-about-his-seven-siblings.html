Keep reading to meet all of the actor’s seven siblings.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Hollywood actor Macaulay Culkin rose to fame as a child when he starred in the world-renowned movie franchise, “<a href=#>Home Alone</a>.” He is also well known for his roles in several other movies such as “Richie Rich,” “The Nutcracker,” and “My Girl.”</p><p>His personal life has always been subject to attention from fans, and his family has captivated millions worldwide. Who are the actor’s siblings, and what do we know about them?&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/369912177_1999947933674870_7491421445546614411_n-1-1.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Macaulay_Culkins_Siblings></span>Macaulay Culkin’s Siblings<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The “Home Alone” actor has <a href=#>seven siblings</a>. Their parents were Kit Culkin and his longtime partner Patricia Brentrup. The couple were together from 1974 to 1995 but never got married during their nearly 20 years together.&nbsp;</p><p>They shared eight kids, including Macaulay, before they split in 1995. Macaulay Culkin’s siblings, in chronological order, are:</p><ul><li>Jennifer&nbsp;</li><li>Shane</li><li>Dakota</li><li>Kieran</li><li>Quinn</li><li>Christian, and</li><li>Rory.</li></ul><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Jennifer_Adamson></span>Jennifer Adamson&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Jennifer was the firstborn child of Kit Culkin, and she was born from a previous relationship he had before meeting Patricia Bretnup. She was also the only child in the Culkin clan, a half-sibling, and her mother was Adeena VanWagoner.</p><p>Jennifer was born on June 27, 1970, in Missoula, Montana. She attended Sentinel High School in 1988 and the Seattle Central Community College, where she graduated after a few years. After graduating, Jennifer worked as a supervisor at a group home for adults with disabilities.&nbsp;</p><p>Sadly, she died of an overdose at her home in Missoula on May 20, 2000. Her mother, Adeena VanWagoner, suffered greatly from the grief and passed away in 2000, just five months after her daughter’s untimely death.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Shane_Culkin></span>Shane Culkin<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Shane is the oldest Culkin child who is currently still living. He was born in 1976 in New York City and is the first child of Kit and Bretnup’s relationship. Much is not known about Shane, but it is known that he was involved in the acting industry for a while.&nbsp;</p><p>He was involved in a TV series called “Great Performances” and played the role of Wally Webb on Broadway at Lincoln Center Theater. Many do not know that Shane’s name was inspired by his father’s favorite film, “Shane,” produced in 1953.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Dakota_Culkin></span>Dakota Culkin<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Dakota was the second child of Kit and Bretnup. She was also born in New York City on June 15, 1978. Like most of her siblings, Dakota was passionate about the movie industry. However, her love for the industry was not for the on-screen acting but on the other side of the camera. She was credited on IMDB as an art production assistant on the 2009 supernatural thriller “Lost Soul.”</p><p>Sadly, Dakota lost her life in 2008, at age 30, when she was struck by a car crossing a street in Marina del Rey, California. All her siblings greatly miss her, and many wonder what her future may have looked like if she were alive today.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Kieran_Culkin></span>Kieran Culkin<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Kieran was born on September 30, 1982, and is one of the more known Culkin siblings. He started his acting career as a child, just like Macaulay in “Home Alone” and “Home Alone 2: Lost in New York.”&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/337567365_518261810462602_5408486742580188928_n.jpg><p>Also, like his brother, Kieran continued to build his acting career over the years and has become successful in the movie industry. In 2002, he played the titular role in the film “Igby Goes Down,” earning him a Golden Globe nomination.&nbsp;</p><p>He also earned more Golden Globes nominations for his role as a leading cast member in HBO’s “Succession” in 2018, 2020, and 2021.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Quinn_Culkin></span>Quinn Culkin<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Like her brothers, Quinn was also born in New York City, where their family lived. She was born on November 8, 1984, and is a lesser-known Culkin sibling.</p><p>She worked in the movie industry as an actress in “Wish Kid” and “The Good Son” with her brother Macaulay as her co-star.&nbsp;However, Quinn quit shortly after as she preferred to live a quiet life away from the media.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Christian_Culkin></span>Christian Culkin<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Christian is the second youngest of the clan and was born in 1987. Like Quinn, he has an acting credit for his role in the 1994 film “My Summer Story,” but left the acting world without acting in another part.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Rory_Culkin></span>Rory Culkin<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Rory Hugh Culkin was also born in New York City and is the youngest. He was born on July 21, 1989, and started acting as a child.&nbsp;He sometimes played younger versions of Macaulay in movies while playing more minor roles in other films.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/187012349_132630888922416_6375839581865433801_n.jpg><p>Now, Rory is an established movie industry actor with numerous film and TV credits. A few notable ones include “Scream 4,” “Swarm,” “Law & Order: Special Victims Unit,” and “Under the Banner of Heaven.”</p><p>It is clear that Macaulay Culkin’s siblings are a highly talented bunch and are all doing well for themselves.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51kuqKvwK6jmrFdmMKtt8inqmarmZe5qrrGrGSapJxirqO71K1koaGjYsCmwsSnZKyhkqG2r7PSaA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./massey-ferguson-50.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Massey Ferguson 50 HP Tractor Price, Specs, Review 2022">&larr;
