But what you might not have realized is that Newt Scamander was on the Marauder's Map in Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, proving that this is actually not the first time we've seen Newt in a film.<h2>Why is Newt Scamander in Marauders map?</h2>The theory that makes the most sense is that Newt was visiting Dumbledore. People who have seen Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them in theaters will know that Dumbledore was Newt's teacher at Hogwarts.<h2>Is Newt Scamander in Harry Potter Prisoner of Azkaban?</h2>In 2004's Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, Fred and George Weasley memorably give Harry the Marauder's Map. As they explain how to use the massively useful tool, which shows you where anyone in Hogwarts is at any given time, a strange name appears. Yep: Newt Scamander.<h2>Did Newt ever meet Harry?</h2>Though Newt is still alive during the Harry Potter series, he never meets Harry (and therefore readers never encounter him in person) because his life doesn't really intersect with Harry's. At the time Harry was introduced to the wizarding world, Newt would've presumably already retired.<h2>Why Newt Scamander Was on the Marauder's Map (Easter Egg) - Harry Potter Theory</h2><p></p><h2>Is Newt Scamander related to Luna Lovegood?</h2>In 2015, J.K. Rowling indeed revealed that, after the Battles of Hogwarts, Luna married Newt Scamander's grandson, who is a magizoologist himself too.<h2>Is Aragog from Newt?</h2>Hagrid got Aragog from Newt Scamander!!! Aragog, the Acromantula, explains how he came to be with Hagrid in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets: "I came to Hagrid from a distant land, in the pockets of a traveler."<h2>Why is Queenie with Grindelwald?</h2>While initially on the same side as her sister Tina and friend, later brother-in-law Newt Scamander, Queenie was ultimately swayed to join Gellert Grindelwald's side with the offer to be free to love and marry her No-Maj boyfriend Jacob Kowalski, as well as the offer to provide his freedom to others.<h2>Is Newt Scamander Hagrid's dad?</h2>Short and sweet - Newt Scamander.<h2>Is Newt Scamander an Animagus?</h2>For his Animagus form: As the fantastic Magizoologist that he is, he has a strong sense of curiosity with great compassion. And very adventurous. He also doesn't like conflicts and could be quite shy in human interactions, but he does the right thing and stands up when he needs to (an awesome Hufflepuff, as he is).<h2>Is Luna Lovegood a Scamander?</h2>Luna Scamander (née Lovegood) (b. 13 February, 1981) was a witch and the only child and daughter of Xenophilius and Pandora Lovegood.<h2>Is Scamander autistic?</h2>Redmayne believes that Scamander has Asperger's but would not have been diagnosed because the term was not widely used during his lifetime. It's important to note that Asperger's is now considered to be part of the autism spectrum and is not a term that is used on its own anymore.<h2>Who is stronger Harry or Newt?</h2>Winner: Harry Potter Is Better Positioned as a Hero Due to His Choices. While Newt was clearly the more skilled wizard between him and Harry, there's no denying that in terms of heroism, Harry was most fit to win. His childhood came with more surprises and traumas than most of the other children in his school.<h2>What is Newt Scamander's Patronus?</h2>There's only one answer, and it's that the Kelpie is Newt's Patronus. A Kelpie is a shape-shifting beast that lives within water. It is not to be approached by humans — unless they want to be eaten. Newt documented the Kelpie in his hit book Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.<h2>What does Grindelwald's skull say?</h2>The inscription on the front of the skull included: Gellert Grindelwald's army symbol. The German inscription "Für das Größere Wohl", meaning in English "For the Greater Good".<h2>Does Queenie stay evil?</h2>Ultimately, though, Sudol believes Queenie is still a good person: “I still believe in her heart of hearts she's going over to fight what she believes in. Grindelwald is saying, 'we're creating a different world' and the world that she is in is broken. I don't believe she's turning evil.<h2>Do Jacob and Queenie have babies?</h2>She has difficulty walking through the fire at the end because she is pregnant with Jacob's baby and it gets burned up. She probably wasn't aware of it but it would explain her enchanting him and pushing so strongly/crazily for marriage.<h2>Did Newt give Dumbledore Fawkes?</h2>Instead, it was likely Newt who acted as Fawkes's trainer before giving him to Dumbledore.<h2>Is Tom Riddle in Fantastic Beasts?</h2>So far, Fantastic Beasts hasn't featured a young Tom Riddle, but it wouldn't be surprising if the final movie (whether Secrets of Dumbledore or another one) shows Riddle graduating Hogwarts and creating his first Horcruxes, linking the series to that of Harry Potter.<h2>Is Newt Scamander Tom Riddle?</h2>In an alternate universe, Newt Scamander isn't traversing the globe in search of magical creatures, but causing trouble and opening the Chamber of Secrets at Hogwarts as a young Tom Riddle.<h2>Is Harry related to Godric Gryffindor?</h2>Harry is descended from both Salazar Slytherin (through his mother) and Godric Gryffindor (through his father).<h2>Is Queenie Snape's mother?</h2>They are from different families. Though Queenie might be related to Anthony Goldstein. Yeah, there are some similarities between them like they both were half blood and what u said but they are not related in any way. Also, Queenie was a naturally born legillimen while Snape had acquired that skill.<h2>Who is newts grandson?</h2>Luna Lovegood ends up marrying Rolf Scamander, who is Newt's grandson.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrTnqmvoZWsrrOxwGeaqKVfm66ye8isZJutk6Cvpq3KZqWer6Rirm6%2FwpqkmqaUmr8%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./jared-polis.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jared Polis (Governor of Colorado)  Wiki, Age, Wife, Net Worth, Children">&larr;
