Even you should have already heard this that her ex-husband Joe Guidice, with no shame in the single game, <span>commented a flirty message on an Instagram post implying his interest in none other than his ex-wife’s soon-to-be sister-in-law Dr. Veronica Ruelas.</span></p><p>And that brings us to fans burning queries about Veronica Ruelas — who she is, her age, job, family background, and all.</p><h3><strong>Meet Veronica Ruelas, Luis Ruelas Sister</strong></h3><p>Teresa Guidice fans have known Veronica Ruelas as Teresa’s soon-to-be sister-in-law for a while now.</p><p>And Veronica, and also her other sister, Jennifer Ruelas, have often appeared to have a close equation with Teresa, their brother’s girlfriend-turned-fianceé. Teresa and Veronica’s brother Luis “Louie” Ruelas also apparently had the upcoming 6th August (2022) marked as their wedding day. Before this, they had gotten engaged in October 2021, one year after Teresa finalized her divorce from Joe.</p><p>Also as of now, all of us know this: Teresa and Joe are the parents to Gia, 21, Gabriella, 17, Milania, 16, and Audriana, 12.</p><p>As for Veronica’s brother Luis, he was married to <a href=#>Marisa DiMartino</a> and also dated girlfriend <a href=#>Vanessa Moretto</a> in the past.</p><h3><strong>What Did Joe Giudice Say About Luis Ruelas Sister, Veronica Ruelas?</strong></h3><p>Most probably the whole RHONJ clan now knows Veronica; as Teresa when sharing some glimpses from her 50th birthday celebration posted a picture with Veronica and her other “sister in love” and down in the comment box appeared a flirty “Is the tall one married?” from the ex-husband Joe. Yes. Joe, who previously dated Daniela Fittipaldi, was hitting on Veronica as he publicly wanted to know if she was available for dating.</p><h3><strong>Is Veronica Ruelas Married?</strong></h3><p>The answer to Joe’s famous question is ‘yes’. Veronica is indeed a married woman. It was the 13th of July in 2018 when she tied the knot to Gary Thomas Giglio at the Loeb Boathouse in Central Park.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gossipnextdoor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/veronica-ruelas-bio-age-married-job-luis-ruelas-sister-2022-300x243.jpg><p>And just a year after they got married, the couple had purchased a Waterview home by DeVito & Company at 26 Parrish Pond Lane in Shinnecock Hills for $4.45 million. So, they had paid the amount for eight bedrooms and 9.5 baths on 1.38 acres, and the property was originally offered for $5.3 million.</p><p>Before getting married, the couple had met in 2015 on a blind date set up by a mutual friend and their first date was at the Atrio restaurant at the Conrad Hotel in New York. And at the time, both of them had already been once married and divorced.</p><p>Gary, here, was a partner in Goldman Sachs in New York by 2018. Son of the late Theresa L. Giglio and the late Vincent J. Giglio of Croton-on-Hudson, New York, he graduated from West Point and received an M.B.A. from Dartmouth College. Also at this point, Gary’s mother was a personnel director for Maryknoll Fathers and Brothers, and his father was an athletic director, coach, and teacher in the Lakeland School District in Shrub Oak.</p><h3><strong>Veronica Ruelas Age</strong></h3><p>Born in early 1972, Veronica Ruelas reached the age of 50 in 2022.</p><h3><strong>Veronica Ruelas Job</strong></h3><p>Veronica goes around as an optometrist, entrepreneur, published author, influencer, and philanthropist.</p><p>She got her Bachelors in Psychology and Biology at Dominican College of Blauvelt in June 1995 and received her doctorate in Optometry from the New York School of Optometry in June 1998. She has since then been working as an optometrist among other jobs.</p><p>At the age of 46, when Veronica got married, she was an optometric physician in private practice in New York. Much before that in 2008, she had founded the non-profit ThirdEyeVision foundation. One could book an appointment at the clinic located at 220 Murray Street New York.</p><p>In January 2021, Veronica took on a new full-time role of founder and Co-CEO at FORGIVITY, a mobile app. And the next month, she co-founded Two Plume Productions.</p><p>Now with over 24 years of experience in successful optometric practice, she has been the driving force behind these behavioral and spiritual sciences.</p><h3><strong>Is Veronica Ruelas On Instagram?</strong></h3><p>Veronica Ruelas did have an account on Instagram <a href=#>@ashramchic</a>. But it was set to private and as of 9 June 2022, she had made some 642 posts and entertained around 4,058 people.</p><p>However, unlike here, she publicly shared glimpses from her life on ‘Dr Veronica Ruelas’ <a href=#>Facebook</a>.</p><h3><strong>Related FAQs</strong></h3><ul><li><h4><strong>Where Does Veronica Ruelas Reside?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>As of the time of this writing, Veronica was likely based in Florida. Albeit, she was born to a New York City family of Hispanic background, to Iris L. Ruelas of Allendale, New Jersey, and Luis Ruelas of Rockland County, New York.</p><p>Veronica’s father is a retired Army veteran and he also used to be an executive for Foot Locker, the New York-based athletic retailer. Meanwhile, her mother is a licensed clinical social worker at St. Dominic’s School in Blauvelt, New York until 2018.</p><ul><li><h4><strong>How Tall Is Veronica Ruelas?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Veronica, who is also a trained yogi, stands above 5’10” tall in height.</p><ul><li><h4><strong>When Is Veronica Ruelas’s Birthday?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Veronica Ruelas celebrates her birthday in January.
