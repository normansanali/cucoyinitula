But the two were not always on the same page in the love department.</p><p>Contrariwise, Streisand considered him “not the ideal fit” for her following their first meeting. Appearing on “The Tonight Show” with Jimmy Fallon, the actress recounted how she made a mean comment about his hair on their first blind date.</p><p><a href=#>According to</a> her, she expected a guy with brown beards and brown wavy hair like a mountain man. When he fell short of her expectation, she could not stop herself from ruffling his hair and asking who messed it up.</p><p>The not-so-dreamy first encounter did not deter James Brolin from falling for her at first sight. Thankfully, Streisand came to reciprocate his feelings days later and the rest is history.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Barbra-Streisand-and-James-Brolin-on-the-Secrets-to-Their-20-Year-Marriage-1024x811.jpeg><p>A story of how James Brolin landed himself one of the most successful women in showbiz?

At birth, he was named Craig Kenneth Bruderlin but adopted the screen name James Brolin along the way to better fit his career path.</p><p>Growing up, Brolin fancied animals and airplanes and hoped to make a career out of it. But that changed when he discovered acting in his teenage years, with James Dean as his inspiration.</p><p>After graduating high school, where he befriended future actor Ryan O’Neal, Brolin’s parents encouraged him to pursue his dreams. Hence, he enrolled at the University of California to study drama.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/James-Brolins-Life-in-Pieces-Celebrity-TV-News-1024x588.jpeg><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Barbra_Streisands_Husband_Built_His_Acting_Career></span><strong>Barbra Streisand’s Husband Built His Acting Career</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>While in college, James Brolin took on minor roles in TV shows like “Bus Stop, and Batman,” among others.

His first marriage was to a woman named Jane Cameron Agee in 1966. Their union yielded two children before coming to an end in 1984.</p><p>Agee passed away nine years later in a car accident.

Although the couple never welcomed children together, they happily groomed their blended family comprising Brolin’s three children and Streisand’s only child Jason Gould.</p><p>On how they have sustained their marriage for so long, the couple once revealed they remained open to each other, giving room for no secret. Being an open book has remained the big <a href=#>secret</a> to their long-lived union.</p><p>So far, they have continued to live in marital bliss, <a href=#>braving many storms</a>, including the coronavirus pandemic, which served to further strengthen their love life.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51kuqax02aZmqqSp65uv9OrnKKrkaOxtHnHrqqbmZ6ZequtzJ6qZpqipLmquo4%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./monopoly-go-scotties-spa-event-rewards-milestones-how-to-win-how-to-get-them-all-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Monopoly Go: Scotties Spa Event  Rewards, Milestones, How To Win &amp;amp; How To Get Them All?">&larr;
