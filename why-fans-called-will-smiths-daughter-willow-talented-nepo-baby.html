These are young people who have succeeded in entering the industry and maintaining fame and wealth because of the wealth and connections that were afforded to them by their parents or other family members.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Some of the most famous nepo babies include the Jenners, Johnny Depp's daughter Lily Rose Depp, Hailey Bieber, and many others. These young people have often been criticized for lacking talent and relying on their family connections to secure their place in the industry.</p><p>However, <a href=#>not all of these so-called nepo babies lack talent</a>.
