Let’s run through the main characters, as well as some of them that have made enough regular appearances that you know who they are by now if you’ve been in on the show through its four seasons so far.</p><p data-characters=229 data-current-count=229 data-injectable=false>And you’ll notice that some of the new crew members are actually in their teens right now, which is good for the show, especially as it continues on. Some characters might even start to phase out or graduate on to other things.</p><p data-characters=132 data-current-count=361 data-injectable=false>Even with that said, still be prepared to say “wow, but she/he looks so young!” quite a few times as you read through this list.</p><h2 id=h-miguel-diaz-xolo-mariduena data-injectable=false><strong>Miguel Diaz (Xolo Maridueña)</strong></h2><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=661 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=118 data-current-count=118 data-injectable=false>The boy who became a man right before our eyes over the first four seasons, Miguel is the heart and soul of Cobra Kai.</p><p data-characters=278 data-current-count=396 data-injectable=false>Sure, other characters emerge and even share as much screen time, but the central plotline still revolves around Miguel and Johnny, Miguel and his mom, Carmen, and Johnny and Carmen. The LaRusso’s are primary as well, but every real fan knows where our allegiances really lie.</p><p data-characters=272 data-current-count=668 data-injectable=true>And we see Miguel emotionally and mentally growing up as well as season four winds down, with him starting out on his own to Mexico City to find his biological father, somewhat inspired by Robby and Johnny, even if their relationship still leaves a lot left to be desired.</p><p data-characters=115 data-current-count=115 data-injectable=false>The actor, Xolo Maridueña, did the same, going from a teenager to an of-age man, as he just turned 21 this summer.</p><h2 data-injectable=false><strong>Samantha LaRusso (Mary Mouser)</strong></h2><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=415 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=160 data-current-count=160 data-injectable=false>The person on the other end of the love story that keeps coming back around and has fueled a lot of the show’s storylines is Mary Mouser’s Samantha LaRusso.</p><p data-characters=186 data-current-count=346 data-injectable=false>Sam has plenty of fallouts with the core characters of the show, but she seems to rally behind the right people and eventually brings out the best in them (well, we’ll see with Robby).</p><p data-characters=195 data-current-count=541 data-injectable=true>While she may look young (as do plenty of the characters of the show), she’s actually 26 years old in real life, but has nailed the persona of being a confused teen trying to figure it all out.</p><h2 data-injectable=false><strong>Robby Keene (Tanner Buchanan)</strong></h2><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=139 data-current-count=439 data-injectable=true>Perhaps seen as the heartthrob and/or bad boy of the show, Robby has faced a ton of adversity and had to come of age well before his years.</p><p data-characters=290 data-current-count=290 data-injectable=false>From loner to on the lam, jumping from father figure to father figure while keeping his real dad, Johnny Lawrence, at bay through most of the series so far; Robby is lured to the dark side a little too easily at times, even as he turns face and does the right thing every now and then, too.</p><p data-characters=96 data-current-count=386 data-injectable=false>While on the screen he still seems to be a teen, the actor, Tanner Buchanan, is 23 years of age.</p><h2 data-injectable=false><strong>Eli “Hawk” Moskowitz (Jacob Bertrand)</strong></h2><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=686 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=90 data-current-count=90 data-injectable=false>The next two characters have to be considered together always, even when they’re rivals.</p><p data-characters=205 data-current-count=295 data-injectable=false>We’re thrilled that both Hawk and Demetri have reconciled (mostly because Hawk stopped being a douchey jackass), and for sure, when the show started out in 2018, they both looked like and were teenagers.</p><p data-characters=153 data-current-count=448 data-injectable=true>Considering the journey Hawk, who is going by Eli again in season four’s end, has gone through, it’s been a treat watching him grow through the show.</p><p data-characters=43 data-current-count=43 data-injectable=false>Jacob Bertrand is now 22 years old, though.</p><h2 data-injectable=false><strong>Demetri Alexopoulos (Gianna DeCenzo)</strong></h2><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=343 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=139 data-current-count=482 data-injectable=true>One of the youngest actors on the set, the actor who plays Demetri, Gianna DeCenzo, is still just on the cusp of adulthood at 20 years old.</p><p data-characters=191 data-current-count=191 data-injectable=false>His practicality and sometimes dour demeanor is still steeped in reality, and we couldn’t be more thrilled that not only did his best friend come around, but he even found love in the show.</p><h2 data-injectable=false><strong>Tory Nichols (Peyton List)</strong></h2><p data-characters=249 data-current-count=440 data-injectable=true>Going back and forth between someone you want to root for, someone you want to hate, and someone you can both empathize and sympathize with, Peyton List plays Tory Nichols perfectly, encapsulating the layers that come along with her rough childhood.</p><p data-characters=77 data-current-count=77 data-injectable=false>List joined the show already out of her teens, and is 24 years old right now.</p><h2 data-injectable=false><strong>Aisha Robinson (Nichole Brown)</strong></h2><p data-characters=265 data-current-count=342 data-injectable=false>Samantha’s best friend who endears us all, we’re still saddened that she didn’t remain a bigger part of the show in the latter seasons. The actress, Nichole Brown (who hails from NFL Hall of Fame lineage) is out of her teen years now as well, at 21 years old.</p><h2 data-injectable=false><strong>Moon (Hannah Kepple)</strong></h2><p data-characters=188 data-current-count=530 data-injectable=true>Moon sticks by Hawk’s side even as he grows darker and darker, but she eventually is the lens through which we see his true heart. Hannah Kepple is 21 now and will turn 22 this November.</p><h2 data-injectable=false><strong>Anthony LaRusso (</strong><strong>Griffin Santopietro</strong><strong>)</strong></h2><p data-characters=120 data-current-count=120 data-injectable=false>The kid who plays Anthony LaRusso, Griffin Santopietro, can’t really be called a kid anymore, either on-screen or off.</p><p data-characters=216 data-current-count=336 data-injectable=false>When one goes through their growth spurt during a show’s progress, they are going to look a bit different as the show goes on, and he surely does deviate from season one when he was just 13. He is now 17 years old.</p><h2 data-injectable=false><strong>Bert (Owen Morgan)</strong></h2><p data-characters=156 data-current-count=492 data-injectable=true>Not a main character, but he appears in every season still, and we’re happy when Bert, played by Owen Morgan, is on screen. The actor turned 18 this year.</p><h2 data-injectable=false><strong>Kyler Park (Joe Seo)</strong></h2><p data-characters=266 data-current-count=266 data-injectable=false>One of the bad kids, especially pushing season one (and Miguel’s progress) forward and returning often as a tormentor, the actor Joe Seo, who plays Kyler, just turned 32 years old in July of this year. He’s by far one of the older ‘kids’ on the show.</p><h2 data-injectable=false><strong>Yasmine</strong><strong> </strong><strong>(Annalisa Cochrane)</strong><strong></strong></h2><p data-characters=208 data-current-count=474 data-injectable=true>At first a bully, and provocateur, she comes to be Demetri’s love interest in the most recent season. While on screen they’re in the same grade, she is a bit older than he is in real life at 26 years old.</p><h2 data-injectable=false><strong>Stingray (Paul Walter Hauser)</strong></h2><p data-characters=180 data-current-count=180 data-injectable=false>An older Cobra Kai student even in the show, and totally obnoxious, Paul Walter Hauser plays the part so well all the way up to framing Johnny in season four. Right now, he’s 35.</p><h2 data-injectable=false><strong>Mitch (Aedin Minks)</strong></h2><p data-characters=133 data-current-count=313 data-injectable=false>Not a huge player, but he’s in there often enough and you know him when you see him. He is 21 years old on the cusp of season five.</p><h2 data-injectable=false><strong>Chris (</strong><strong>Khalil Everage</strong><strong>)</strong></h2><p data-characters=262 data-current-count=575 data-injectable=true>Chris and Mitch also go hand-in-hand as they joined Cobra Kai together. They both follow Hawk as he becomes a leader of sorts and someone who those that were once bullied look up to as a role model to get revenge. The actor, Khalil Everage, is also 21 years old.</p><h2 data-injectable=false><strong>Nathaniel (</strong><strong>Nathaniel Oh</strong><strong>)</strong></h2><p data-characters=107 data-current-count=107 data-injectable=false>A younger member of the show both on and off-screen, Oh is 15 and will turn 16 while season five is airing.</p><p data-characters=119 data-current-count=226 data-injectable=false>Nathaniel Oh’s character goes through some tough stuff as well, but he also turns into a bully of Kenny at one point.</p><h2 data-injectable=false><strong>Doug Rickenberger (</strong><strong>John Cihangir</strong><strong>)</strong></h2><p data-characters=142 data-current-count=368 data-injectable=false>Though his on-screen time is a bit limited, the actor John Cihangir, who plays Doug, is actually a stunt man as well, and he’s 28 years old.</p><p data-characters=145 data-current-count=513 data-injectable=true>He was even nominated for an Emmy for his stunt work on Cobra Kai in 2021, and is known as Dustin’s stunt double from Stranger Things, too.</p><h2 data-injectable=false><strong>Piper Elswith (</strong><strong>Selah Austria</strong><strong>)</strong><strong></strong></h2><p data-characters=108 data-current-count=108 data-injectable=false>Moon’s ex-girlfriend, who gets beaten by Sam at the All-Valley Tournament in season four, is 21 years old.</p><h2 data-injectable=false><strong>Kenny Payne (Dallas Dupree Young)</strong></h2><p data-characters=146 data-current-count=254 data-injectable=false>One of the newer members of the show, it’s clear that Kenny will have a bigger role going forward after his entrance to the show in season four.</p><p data-characters=230 data-current-count=484 data-injectable=true>He is meant to be a bit smaller and younger in the show, and will bring on a new era of Cobra Kai, we think, as some of the other characters (and actors) start to age past believability for the roles they’re playing on the show.</p><p data-characters=64 data-current-count=64 data-injectable=false>Dallas Dupree Young, who plays Kenny, is currently 15 years old.</p><h2 data-injectable=false><strong>Devon Lee (</strong><strong>Oona O’Brien</strong><strong>)</strong></h2><p data-characters=140 data-current-count=204 data-injectable=false>Another newbie to the show, she might have a bigger role in season five too. The actress Oona O’Brien is also a real teen at 16 years old.</p><h2 data-injectable=false><strong>Lia Cabrera (</strong><strong>Milena Rivero</strong><strong>)</strong></h2><p data-characters=96 data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false>She helps torment Kenny early on, helping turn him toward karate and setting up a new storyline.</p><p data-characters=99 data-current-count=399 data-injectable=false>As many of the newcomers to the show, she is smack in the middle of her teen years at 15 years old.</p><h2 data-injectable=false><strong>Zach Thompson</strong><strong> (</strong><strong>Brock Duncan</strong><strong>)</strong><strong></strong></h2><p data-characters=84 data-current-count=483 data-injectable=true>Another Kenny tormentor as part of Anthony LaRusso’s crew, he’s 14 in real life.</p><h2 data-injectable=false><strong>Marcus (</strong><strong>Jaden Labad</strong><strong>)</strong></h2><p data-characters=101 data-current-count=101 data-injectable=false>One more member of the punks running with Anthony early in season four, he’s turning 15 this month.</p><p data-characters=0 data-current-count=101 data-injectable=false></p><p data-characters=143 data-current-count=244 data-injectable=false>There we go, a nearly full-on and comprehensive list of the ‘kids’ of Cobra Kai, which many of whom aren’t even kids anymore.</p><p data-characters=57 data-current-count=301 data-injectable=false>Season five of Cobra Kai comes to Netflix on September 9.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3ypu9ZmpqWcXZa%2FpnnToZxmo5mZwG67xWaaqJqilnqsrcho</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./how-patrick-dempsey-really-got-the-nickname-mcdreamy.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How Patrick Dempsey Really Got The Nickname 'McDreamy'">&larr;
