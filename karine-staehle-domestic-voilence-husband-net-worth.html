Fans are concerned for the safety of not only their children but also Paul’s safety. The hidden video clip showed Karine Staehle use violence against her husband in front of their youngest child.</span></p><p><span>The video was out in the internet through Foxtech Marketing’s YouTube channel where raw footage of the reality star couple in their home in Louisville, Kentucky. It can be seen in the video, Paul was getting screamed at by his wife, Karine in the presence of Pierre, their youngest son. Later, the discussion turned to physical assault as Karine grabbed his hair and jerked his head back sharply and pinned Paul to the couch.</span></p><p><span>&nbsp;Many fans of the show were surprised and outraged at Karine’s actions and they commented about their concerns on reddit. One user wrote,<strong> “I never expected her to be as violent and aggressive as she is now, it’s shocking. It is not a safe environment for children.”</strong> Another user commented, <strong>“That’s really scary. Who posted this? And if it’s Paul and Karine leaking this, why? By influence? Staying relevant? Or is it a call from help from Paul? I need answers and they need a divorce.”</strong></span></p><h2><strong><span>Karine Staehle Married Life With Husband Paul Staehle</span></strong></h2><p><span>Karine Staehle met Paul Staehle online as explained by Paul how he had not best luck in his past relationships in his land, Kentucky so he looked online for love and met Karine. Despite the language barriers, they communicated through translated text messages and Paul moved to live with her in Brazil.</span></p><p><span>They ultimately got married in Brazil in November 2017. They welcomed their son, Pierre in March 2019. However, the couple faced some problems in their relationship as in July 2020 Paul claimed that his wife and their children were missing after an altercation and later Karine claimed that he sexually assaulted her and didn’t allowed her to leave the house. She wrote in her Instagram, <strong>“I want you all to know that me and Pierre are doing well now. All this past days I had a lot going on. I had issues where the police was called because I feared for my life and my son’s life which led me to ask for help and ultimately be rescued from an environment that no longer was healthy for none of us involved in the situation.”</strong></span></p><p><span>Paul had also shared how things are going with<a href=# rel=noopener> his mom in a since-deleted Instagram Stories</a> where it said,</span></p><p><strong><span>“Breaks my heart here in USA my mother never wants to see my kids anymore. I just asked her if she would like to see them for Halloween, and I got a loud NO. She ended up blocking our phone number and got frustrated. We hired a babysitter to help us with the kids when we are working, or Karine is in college. She believes Karine should drop out of school and be a full-time mother. I do not remember the last time she came to our house to visit. In Brazil, Karine’s family loved seeing our kids daily. Here they seem to be a burden. I mean, it’s Halloween. I would hope she would at least see their costumes.”</span></strong></p><p><span>However, Paul’s stories are presented showing only him the victim so there’s possibility of having more to the stories. As in the past, his mother was always worried about her son and wanted him to step up and provide for his own family.</span></p><p><span>The couple has on and off relationships for several years and Paul has said that he wasn’t aware of the specifics of Karine’s other relationships. The two starred on the TLC series 90 Days Fiance season 1 and season 2. Paul had talked about their plans on appearing on upcoming seasons of 90 Days Fiance and said,<strong> “We were not fired, we were basically given time off to deal with our situations.”</strong></span></p><p><span>Karine welcomed her first child with Paul on March 2019 and named him Pierre. Karine had shared she was fine and had the hard time and said, <strong>“And I am recovering well, but I am still very weak. It was super hard, but now everything is fine because ethe baby is calm and he is breastfeeding well.”</strong></span></p><p><span>Karine had suffered two miscarriages in the past and was pregnant again in 2019.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Who Is Karine Staehle?</span></strong></h2><p><span>Karine Staehle is a Brazilian model and reality star born on 18 January 1996. She became known to the public after her appearance on the TLC series, 90 Days Fiance season 1 and season 2. She is now in her homeland Brazil with her two sons and her husband, Paul Staehle.</span></p><p><span>Its not clear about her net worth.
