This Lauren Williams Bio covers her net worth, husband, and other information.</p><p>Delve into this bio to learn more about her.</p><h3><strong>Are Lauren Williams And Porsha Williams Real Sisters?</strong></h3><p>No, they aren’t real sisters if real means sharing the same parents. Lauren Williams and Porsha Williams are half-sisters who share the same father. The sisters share a close bond and it strengthened even more after they become mothers to their daughters. In May 2021, Lauren took to her Instagram the snap of her time with her daughter Baleigh and her niece Pilar Jhena. She wrote, “<span title=Edited>They say having a niece is like having a 2nd daughter to love and it really is… so can I claim her on my taxes too? #askingforafriend”</span></p><p>They are among the four children <a href=#>Diane T. Williams</a> and Hosea Williams II had. They have two brothers named Hosea Williams III and Brenton Williams.</p><p>On the 10 January 2021 episode, her sister opened up about dealing with her parent’s divorce. She told, “It was just kind of confusing at first because I had my home with Mommy that felt complete, solid. And then over here with Dad was another home that could be complete and solid, and why am I going in between?”</p><p>About growing up with Lauren, Porsha also shared, “She’s lived with Daddy, and I more so came over on the weekends but saying ‘half anything would get you a spanking in the house.”</p><p>Her father passed away in 1998 of complications from a bone marrow transplant, after being diagnosed with a rare form of leukemia the year prior. He died at the age of 43. At that time, Lauren was only 10 years old.</p><p>Lauren shared about her father, “I remember him waking up in the morning, kissing me on the forehead, and going to work, not coming back until it was time to go to bed,”</p><p>As for her mom, Diane is an entrepreneur and public speaker. She runs a daycare business. She also appeared on “The Real Housewives of Atlanta” in a total of 24 episodes of the show.</p><h3><strong>How Much Is Lauren Williams Net Worth?</strong></h3><p>Lauren Williams has a net worth of over $1 million. Lauren is into the spirituality business.</p><p>Her socials state that she is a meditation teacher, a host, an entrepreneur, and a mindful mommy. Moreover, Lauren uses her platform to share her health and wellness journey through her social media following while advocating for the elimination of hunger and homelessness, assistance for single mothers, mental health, activism for civil justice, and speaking at the March of Dimes.</p><p>Lauren runs her own mask business called “<a href=#>Real Life Snacks</a>.” The business is known for making masks, hats, patches, and mother articles.</p><p>The business website states that their products are lightweight and fast drying. The masks are for fashionable women and also perfect for men with beards. The masks can cost up to $24.99 and come in a variety of colors and designs. Whereas, hats can cost up to $34.98 also come with various designs.</p><p>Furthermore, Lauren is also the co-owner of “<a href=#>Go Naked Hair</a>.” The business specializes in selling headband wigs, bundles, lace, and lashes. You can view their product <strong><a href=#>here</a></strong>.</p><p>Besides running businesses, Lauren also hosts workshops regularly such as The Intention Retreat with&nbsp;level 3 yoga.</p><h3><strong>Lauren Williams Husband Or Boyfriend?</strong></h3><p>As of Dec 2021, Lauren Williams might be single. And the reason behind the assumption was almost no pictures of any men that could be his boyfriend — or a husband, for that matter — since February 2021. Because February 2021 is the last time Lauren and her boyfriend Nate Patterson appeared together. She hasn’t posted pictures of her man ever since.</p><p>The couple went public with their <a href=#>relationship</a> in January 2020. Lauren opened up about her then-new relationship and confirmed that she and Nate were together every day for three months. She hashtagged the post “Laurentined” as it was the time of the COVID-19 pandemic and they quarantined together.</p><p>Lauren also celebrated her man’s birthday with a post she captioned, “if amethyst charged lavender oil-soaked marijuana was a person.” and described him as her safe space.</p><p>To further support the speculation of their break, it is also discoverable that Lauren appeared on her boyfriend, Nate’s IG for the <a href=#>last time</a> in September 2020. So, they have either broken up or aren’t posting as much on their socials as they used to.</p><h3><strong>Lauren Williams Baby Daddy</strong></h3><p>The only thing that we know about Lauren Williams’s baby daddy is his name is Vernon Bowie. Vernon and Lauren welcomed their daughter Baleigh in 2016. They registered the arrival date of their baby on 30 January 2016 in <a href=#>Amazon</a>.</p><h3><strong>How Old Is Lauren Williams?</strong></h3><p>Lauren Williams was 33 years old as of Dec 2021.</p><h3><strong>When Does Lauren Williams Celebrate Her Birthday?</strong></h3><p>According to several online sources, Lauren Williams celebrates her birthday on 18 February.</p><h3><strong>Related FAQs</strong></h3><ul><li><h4><strong>How Tall Is Lauren Williams?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Lauren Williams stands tall to the height of 5 feet 8 inches.</p><ul><li><h4><strong>What Are Some Of The Job Titles Donned By Lauren Williams?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Some of the jobs titled donned by Lauren are Meditation teacher, co-owner businesses, and yoga instructor.</p><ul><li><h4><strong>Is Lauren Williams On Instagram, Twitter?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Yes, Lauren is on IG and goes by the name (@lodwill).
